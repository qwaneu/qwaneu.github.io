# What is a heuristic

A heuristic is the most suitable definition of it that we can find at the time of posting, given the limits of our time and understanding.

We hope to have demonstrated a main use of heuristics by example. We engineer this blog post, we want to have a working definition of Heurstic, and can't possibly comprehend everything that has been written about it, before the time to publish about it has past.

> The engineering method is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources.

This description of use comes from the book "Discussion of the Method" by Billy Koen. John L. Jerz wrote [a brief summary](http://johnljerz.com/superduper/tlxdownloadsiteMAIN/id174.html) that we found useful. Gus Power made us aware of this book, when we found the unfinished sentence 'A heuristic is a ' in a draft for a previous post. We forgot what we wanted to say there, so asked Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">... concept that is explained really well in Billy Koen&#39;s book &quot;Discussion of the Method&quot;</p>&mdash; Gus Power (@guspower) <a href="https://twitter.com/guspower/status/1440395708381614081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2021</a></blockquote>

Koen defines a heuristic as follows:

> A heuristic is anything that provides a plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem but is in the final analysis unjustified, incapable of justification, and potentially fallible.

> You and I are participating in a magnificent experiment to see whether Nature's latest wrinkle, the human species armed with its new weapon, intelligence, has survival value.

From page 1 of Koens book. Time to order and read it, perhaps.

thinking of 'groping towards understanding' I think from C2 wiki or chris matts' blog. ah, Richard Feynman -
