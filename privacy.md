### The fine print

We love collaborating with you!

In order to work with you however, we need to know a few things about you. We collect only the bare minimum needed to interact with you: your name, phone number and email address. To ship refactoring cards and other merchandise to you. we need your address. When we run an on-site course we need to know where to show up and who will be in the course - a contact phone number will be handy as well. 

We will never give or sell your data in any form to other parties for marketing purposes.

Give us a shout if you'd like to update your details or have them removed.
