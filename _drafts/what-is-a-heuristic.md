> A heuristic is anything that provides a plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem but is in the final analysis unjustified, incapable of justification, and potentially fallible.

From the book _Discussion of the Method: Conducting the Engineer's Approach to Problem Solving_ by Billy Vaughn Koen.

We have been publishing a number of heuristics in our series on [test driven development heuristics](/blog-by-tag#tag-test-driven-development), but so far we have not defined what a heuristic is. Let's do that now.

We find heuristics, and being explicit about them useful. We are surrounded by uncertainty. They do not, however, deliver guaranteed results for pre-defined situations. Rebecca Wirfs-Brock says in [Growing Your Personal Heuristics Toolkit](http://wirfs-brock.com/blog/2019/03/20/growing-your-personal-design-heuristics/):

> There are no guarantees. Heuristics can fail. The tenacity that defines an engineer is when she steps back, regroups, and finds a different heuristic to try next.

How do heuristics fit in with the bigger picture of (engineering) work? In [a brief summary of "Discussion of the method"](http://johnljerz.com/superduper/tlxdownloadsiteMAIN/id174.html) by John L. Jerz quotes from Koen's book as follows:

> The engineering method is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources.

Fun with heuristics

Gus Power reminded us of "Discussion of the method", when we found the
unfinished sentence "A heuristic is a ..." in a draft for a previous post. We
forgot what we wanted to say in that post, so we asked Twitter to complete that sentence.

**A heuristic is a ...**

Closing thought
-----

From page 1 of Koen's book:

> You and I are participating in a magnificent experiment to see whether Nature's latest wrinkle, the human species armed with its new weapon, intelligence, has survival value.

 We've ordered the book, but it seems to be taking a while to arrive from the US. In the meantime we'll continue to write up some of our [TDD heuristics](/blog-by-tag#tag-test-driven-development).

We hope to write more on heuristics once the book arrives, but for now, within the limits of our current understanding of heuristics, this post must do.

_Discussion of the Method: Conducting the Engineer's Approach to Problem Solving_. By Billy Vaughn Koen. This book is hard to find and expensive. We haven't put a link in. As soon as we've actually received a second hand copy, we will put in a link to the seller's website, because they appeared to have more in stock.

Toolkit](http://wirfs-brock.com/blog/2019/03/20/growing-your-personal-design-heuristics/) by Rebecca Wirfs-Brock.
The XKCD comic contained therein depicts a group decision process that looks
eerily familiar. We particularly like "Always give yourself a chance to
retreat". For us, the trick remains to keep reminding ourselves to use that chance to retreat.
