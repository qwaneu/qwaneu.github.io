Write the last part of your test first: start with the expectation or the
assert, write the test bottom-up.

Starting the test at the end might feel strange, as you may be inclined to write
your test from top to bottom, from set-up, through invocation of production
code, to expectation. This may feel the wrong way around.

Think of it like when you have to write a report (like you had to do when you
were at school): a good approach is to first write up the conclusions, and then
write the rest of the report leading to those conclusions. Writing a test is
similar in this way.

## Focus on the outcome 

The test will focus on a desired outcome, which is often easier to express than
the set up code needed. You will also notice duplication in set up code more
clearly. Starting with the expectation is harder than just copy-pasting the
previous test and changing some words. It forces you to think of desired
behaviour and interfaces right from the beginning.

By starting with the expectation, we focus on the test outcomes and work
backward from there. Once the expectation is clear, we write the minimally
required setup and code to get to our outcome.

It is ok to have it feel wrong and awkward. Starting with an expectation, 
you inject a little deliberate practice in your day to day work. 

## Example

Let's look at an example from our [Online Agile FluencyÂ® Diagnostic
application](/2020/09/25/hexagonal-frontend-example.html). This application
support a facilitator in running a workshop with a development team. This is
represented in the code by a concept _DiagnosticSession_. We would like to
enable co-facilitation, so we want to add a sharing feature to the
DiagnosticSession class. 

How do we start? First create a session? No, let's start with the
expected outcome: a shared session is accessible for the co-facilitator:

```python
def test_sharing_makes_it_accessible_for_the_secondary_facilitator():

  assert_that(session.is_accessible_for(co_facilitator), is_(True))
```

Then we can add the behaviour-under-test:

```python
def test_sharing_makes_it_accessible_for_the_secondary_facilitator(self):

  session.share_with(co_facilitator)
  assert_that(session.is_accessible_for(co_facilitator), is_(True))
```

And finally, we add the setup code:

```python
def test_sharing_makes_it_accessible_for_the_secondary_facilitator(self):
  session = aValidDiagnosticSession(facilitator_id=aValidID('99'))
  co_facilitator = aValidFacilitator(id=aValidID('44'))
  session.share_with(co_facilitator)
  assert_that(session.is_accessible_for(co_facilitator), is_(True))
```

`aValidDiagnosticSession` and `aValidFacilitator` are examples of [test data builders](/2020/10/09/test-data-builders.html).

## Effects

We force ourselves to state our intent first, which helps in design. This again
provides a low-cost, fast feedback loop, helping us to get clear where we want
to go.

The test is focused on the outcome, which helps to reduce clutter, unnecessary
setup code. We prevent our test from wandering around, instead it will go
straight to its goal.

## Legacy code

You may believe that this does not apply to legacy code. Quite the contrary:
although it can be harder, it will help you identify better, less cluttered, and
more focused interfaces for existing code. The effort may be big, but so is the
feeling of increased understanding and relief after you've done it.
