## Take as much care for test code as you do for production code

The tests are an important part of your software product. They will not only guide 
you when growing the production code, but they will also act 
as documentation (examples of how the production code
behaves in different situations) and as a safety net (a feedback system that provides
information about the impact of changes).

Tests need to be clean, readable, fast, explicit, intention revealing!
So in the refactor step of the TDD cycle, we take care of our test code as well.

testing smells and ways to improve these.
