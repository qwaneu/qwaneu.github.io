[No Rules Rules - Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention](https://www.norulesrules.com/) by Reed Hastings (Netflix co-founder & CEO) and Erin Meyer

What I like about the book is the story behind the way of working and the current 'rules'/practices of Netflix. The book shows how Hastings manages the company as a complex system: providing enabling constraints(not too many), trying it out, see where it fails, and adjusting the constraints.

Hastings took his experience from his previous company, where he'd establish new
rules whenever something didn't work out, and set out at Netflix to do this
differently. In his previous company he took the road of establishing more and
more governing constraints and rules, stifling the company. Managing it as a
complicated system, instead of a complex system.

Foundation (principles?) for Netflix:
- _Build up talent density_ - if you focus on high performers, you can get rid of many controls meant for dealing with sloppy, unprofessional, irresponsible behaviour
- _Increase candor_ - employees can learn a lot from each other, you need to get into a feedback habit
- _Reduce controls_ - "lead with context, not with controls"

A culture of freedom and responsibility

## So we should copy Netflix to be successful?

The book describes the current way of working and how they arrived at this through experimenting and adjusting. The risk of book like this is that people take the current state and try to copy it. Copying the motions of Netflix (or some other successful company) won't help you. 

A complex system like an organization has history. The past/road followed led to the current state of affairs. Copying the motions won't get you far, as you are **confusing correlation for causation**. Netflix culture is like it is now because of its history of continuously evolving constraints through experimentation. This is what is helping it to be a successful company. The current way of working is a result of that, not the cause.

> This is similar to what happened to the 'Spotify model': [Henrik Kniberg
shared how Spotify was organizing for scaling up while trying to keep
agile](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf). The
article described a snapshot in time, as Spotify is continuously evolving and
adapting to change. Unfortunately many organizations didn't read Henrik's
disclaimer in the article and starting copying the motions.

Cargo cult

## Hiring Top Performers

Netflix focuses on hiring top performers. Prevent employees that pull down morale, by not being good enough, by slacking or being a jerk (no matter how brilliant a person seems to be).

Netflix also pays employees above market. No performance-based bonuses

So they hire top performers, provide a vision and context, and some enabling constraints and expect them to do their thing. Treat them as the adult they are.

"Performance is contagious" - focusing on high performing people reinforces itself?

I noticed that Reed is referring to some research about software programmer performance (the "rock star principle"), where high performers outperform low performers by an order of magnitude. Productivity in software development is a not well understood topic however with lots of bad or meaningless research around (anyone remember counting lines of code as a measure of productivity?). This research focuses very much on individual performance, while software development is a team sport. 

The performance of a high performing team is more than the sum of the performance of its members. Not saying Netflix is taking a wrong approach (their results show the opposite), but what 'top performer' means does not become clear from the book, I'd be interested to learn more especially for software development.

Performance of an individual is not solely is always a function of the individual's capabilities and the context the person is working in. Although the book mentions they are collaboration focused, I did not see this specific thing explicitly.

Retention: the Keeper Test 

An organization is not a family; a family stays together regardless of
"performance". Netflix asks people (managers, employees themselves) to
frequently do the Keeper Test: "If a person on your team were to quit tomorrow,
would you try to change their mind? Or would you accept their resignation,
perhaps with a little relief? If the latter, you should give them a severance
package now, and look for a star, someone you would fight to keep."

They focus on top performance. If someone shows adequate performance, they will
let go of this person, with a generous severance (again above market and above
what is required by law). So they take a proactive approach to employees that
are not a good fit (compared to other companies who start some painful
improvement program, just wait until the employee leaves by him/herself, or
bully the employee away). Note that attrition is similar to market averages so
it is not working out worse for them.


## Radical candor 

Frequent candid feedback has high leverage: it "exponentially magnifies the speed and effectiveness of your team or workforce"

Build feedback in; coach employees to give/receive feedback effectively. "Feedback anywhere, anytime"

4A Feedback Guidelines:
1. Aim to Assist - give constructive feedback, with positive intent
2. Actionable - what can one do differently?
3. Appreciate - instead of providing defense or excuses
4. Accept or Discard - you're not required to follow it

Netflix experimented with 360 feedback. What they learned:
- do not do them anonymously
- don't tie the feedback to performance reviews
- live 360s, in a small group, e.g. over dinner; can take hours (uncomfortable, but effective); use start/stop/continue

## Remove controls

No holiday policies; no travel and expense policies. Instead of 'pessimistic control' (always asking for permission), they apply 'optimistic control', finance checks samples after the fact. If people overspend, this does not mean a reprimand, but it triggers to have another look at context.

Trust leads to trustworthiness

Lead with context; prerequisites: high talent density, goal is innovation (not error prevention, like in a context where safety is critical), loosely coupled system (with high alignment)

If someone does something dumb, don't blame that person, but ask yourself what
context did you fail to set. I like this systemic perspective, is in line with
Deming's statement that [90-95% of performance is governed by the
system](https://deming.org/dr-deming-called-for-the-elimination-of-the-annual-performance-appraisal/).
Contrast with imposing more rules creates an inflexible context where people
cannot thrive. This highlights a main job of management: working on the system,
creating a context where good results emerge.
