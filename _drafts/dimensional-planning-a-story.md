We will explain how Dimensional Planning can work by telling a story of how we
applied Dimensional Planning in a project we were involved in and how it helped
us to steer the project towards delivering its desired outcomes in time.

## The story

In 2018, we joined a project to develop a new product for one of our customers. In true [agile fluency 'optimizing' style](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html), the team included business, marketing, UX, product vision, and development. We had a simple goal: enter the market with this new product. We had some new insights on dimensional planning and estimating and achieving goals.

> For obvious reasons, we have to apply some discretion here. We cannot share all the project details, but add some concrete examples from the product we're currently working on, the online Agile fluency Diagnostic application.

Let's introduce some of the people involved (not their real names): Sarah was our ambitious business owner; Rob, Magnus, and Wilbert were the developers, Jelle was our UX designer, Diana our marketeer and Anton was our product owner.

We got involved in the project in February when some of the work had already been done. Anton, Diana, Sara and Jelle had created a [user story map](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/). And like often happens, the goals were set: launch an initial (beta) market release by June, launch a full release in September.

We took a week or two to get acquainted with the technology involved (some would call that sprint 0). But then it started to itch. We had set dates the ambition were sky high, but I had this uncomfortable feeling that the plan might not be feasible.

In the company mentioned in the introduction, they created their own variant of the metaphor: paper cup, coffee mug, silver chalice. So the exact metaphor does not matter, as long as it helps the common understanding between development, business, customers.
