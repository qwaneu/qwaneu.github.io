Code must be undertandable for the whole team (and other people and teams when appropriate). Questions about 'what is this?' are an opportunity to improve the design, not for defensiveness. We love having interns and new team members: They ask innocent questions. This reveals assumptions we made when we wrote the code that were invisible to us.
