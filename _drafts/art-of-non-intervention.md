Being a consultant, working in roles of trusted advisor, facilitator, scrum
master, coach, mentor has taught me the subtle art of not intervening.

Not doing an intervention is a powerful intervention. Being conscious of this
helps wielding the power towards the good. As process minded people I and many
other agile people tend to **do** things, help teams, talk to individuals, lead
a group through a process. Especially when paid by the hour, it sometimes feels
we should be doing something - they don't pay us for not doing anything right?

I also notice this when colleage coaches/facilitators are facilitating. They
tend to be there, be in the lead of the group/process (because they like it, are
good at it, the reason they became facilitators).

Many years ago, Willem and I have co-created the Agile Open conference series,
exploring Open Space Technology to run a participant-driven conference. Running
open spaces has been a great exercise and exploration in how much or rather how
little facilitation a group needs to let a great event happen. Willem and I
moved towards minimalism: focusing on the rules and principles, setting up the
spaces, and bringing ourselves to the floor. Besides that we let participants
work out stuff by themselves. 

We found little intervention was needed. Setting the initial conditions and then
intervening as little as needed actually helped participants take ownership of
the process, and make the event work for them.

Being a bit of a conference junkie, I've attended many. I noticed some other
agile open space facilitators trying to be in control of quite a few details,
e.g. intervening when a question arises when participants are co-creating the
program on the wall. People will figure it out. Intervening too soon will nudge
them into waiting for/relying on the facilitator to solve things for them.

# Interventions can weaken a system



# In complex systems, there is no neutral position

One cannot take a neutral stance in a group, team, with a partner, ... I will
have influence on this system, whether I intend it or not. Moving myself
'outside' the system, standing on the sidelines, "just watching", not wanting to
be part of it, does not remove me from the system. Instead taking this stance
will often have unintended consequences.
