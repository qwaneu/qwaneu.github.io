How we think about work time and how we spend it

Assumption: direct work for project/product is valuable work, all the other things are 'overhead' or "work that we should not be doing".
- this is a simplistic lean view on work; we make narrow assumptions about value adding work; broader view: value adding work adds value for customers, users, employees, society
- learning is an indirect value adding activity: amplifies & leverages
- Scrum reinforces this: what is on the backlog is what you should be working on

## Keeping them busy

It is not about being busy. An organization's purpose is not to keep people busy, it is to create a context in which people can create value through collaboration (philosophy/economics alert!)

Roots in capitalism; getting as much value from workers, when there was a direct relation between effort put in and results delivered. Knowledge work is different.

## Product development is not factory work

In product development: making sense of stakeholders/needs/etc is also part of value adding work (like Simon Wardley telling about doing a quick mapping session that could lead to not doing a million $ project)

## Learning Organizations

Like lean production as intended: it is as much about evolving a system (people, knowledge, practice, tools) that knows how to produce better value faster

## Value 

Analogy with economics, production boundary: what do we see as value adding work. This tends to remain implicit. What the product owner says. Or as a developer I assume visible functionalities is the things that is valuable.

Have a discussion about what adds value for whom. Will not just be the users/customers of your product, there will be a larger project community.

## Focusing on focused time

Having focused time to develop results is valuable/important. But you cannot do that for 8 hours straight (or 2x4 hours straight). It is too tiring but it also leaves no room for reflection, contemplation, learning etc

Working in small focused time boxes?

Pomodoro for instance: 25 minutes focused work, 5 minutes unfocused; 25 minutes tends to be short for getting something done in software (we do use this in our courses, and having an enabling constraint like this is challenging but helps to find even smaller steps to working software)

90 minute time boxes (3 pomodoros) seems like a more reasonable to add a thin slice of value.

So a 'work day' could be a mix of a few 90 minute focused time boxes with unstructured time in between for reflection (alone or together), for a bit of reading/watching, trying out some things, or a bit of socializing.
90 minute focused time boxes could be pair/ensemble programming so synchronous time, the other activities lend themselves to some extent for more asynchronicity
