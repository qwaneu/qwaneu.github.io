What's cooking in QWAN's kitchen - September 2023.
## Secure By Design
Last week we delivered the first training day inspired by the book Secure by Design, as part of a multi-year learning path we deliver for an agency in the Netherlands.
## Cloud native software architecture
October will see the first installment of our cloud native software architecture day. We'll mostly focus on keeping things focused on the outcomes you want to achieve, loosely coupled, while benefitting from what a particular cloud has to offer.
## Lean Agile Scotland
Willem and Rob will travel to Edinburgh next week to deliver the first Stigmergy workshop. @@link.

## Agile Cambridge

Agile Cambridge will follow the trail of Stigmergy. Willem and Marc will deliver a slightly shorter (90 mins instead of 120 ), but no less interactive workshop.

## Talking to people
As one of our colleagues said: "We'd rather write blog posts than talk to people". We've found that going out, and hearing for ourselves is very valuable, but it is not something all of us do naturally. Conferences help, but there is a world of people we know outside of conferences, and staying in touch is not always trivial.

Willem and Rob are running some shorter workshops with clients in the Eindhoven area in the week of 9 October. That means Willem will be in the Netherlands for at least several days. He'd love to catch up with people, contact him if you want to have a chat or a drink.

# Call To Action - talk to us, if you can't make it to these conferences
