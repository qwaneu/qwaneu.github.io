I enjoyed watching [Container Solutions](https://www.container-solutions.com/a-pattern-language-for-strategy)' [Jamie Dobson](https://twitter.com/JamieDobson) present an introduction to
their [pattern language for strategy yesterday](https://www.container-solutions.com/a-pattern-language-for-strategy), titled "A
framework for strategy, making decisions in turbulent times".

# A framework for strategy

I recommend  [viewing the recording, 'A Pattern Language for Strategy'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a10_sWM_VuI&feature=youtu.be).

At QWAN patterns are in our [DNA](https://wiki.c2.com/?QualityWithoutaName), and I'm learning about strategy, so this talk
fits.

This pattern language is also available as

-   A book and a pattern library, at [cnpatterns.org](http://www.cnpatterns.org/)
-   [A series of blog posts](https://www.container-solutions.com/a-pattern-language-for-strategy).

There is much to say about it, but following Bias to Action, I've set myself a
deadline and will post my first takeaways.

Bias to Action was mentioned in the presentation, but [is could not find it as a pattern (yet?)](http://www.cnpatterns.org/strategy-risk-reduction).

The titles below taken from the presentation slides or the e-book.

# Strategy is a process

"Strategy is a process, Strategy is not a plan or an edict handed down from on high, but rather the
cumulative results of many, many actions"

I've experienced Strategy handed down, in situations where strategy was
inflicted on development teams I worked in. A collaborative strategy could have
massively reduced risk, time to market and costs. The miracle of close
collaboration and high trust inside a team can make it work regardless. That
doesn't mean the strategy was sound, the process was good or the human cost was
low.

I like the focus here, it takes patience and time. And you have to work
it. Together.

# Characteristics of the Strategist

The strategist has four characteristics:

Empathy, Understanding of Reality, Imagination and Voice

"Don't confuse empathy with weakness"

"Imagination is a cheap place to do work"

The example of Kennedy proposing to putt a man on the moon given with
understanding of reality is food for thought. That was one complex reality.

Voice: "Itâ€™s no good imagining what can be, understanding reality, and
representing your people if you cannot speak."

# Getting ready to gamble

What hadn't dawned on me, even with the visual, right there, in _each of the patterns_, was
that one can represent [No Regret Moves](http://www.cnpatterns.org/strategy-risk-reduction/no-regret-moves), [Options and Hedges](http://www.cnpatterns.org/strategy-risk-reduction/options-and-hedges) and [Big Bets](http://www.cnpatterns.org/strategy-risk-reduction/big-bet) as a
funnel.

The picture shows a narrowing funnel, with more things done in the earlier
stages and fewer later. Experiments on the left are the mechanism for No Regret Moves,
Proofs of Concept to execute Options and Hedges, and Minimal Viable Products for
Big Bets. Each item gets more expensive as one moves to the right.

The funnel is shown in each pattern. Sometimes I need to
see, read, and hear things a few times before they settle.

No Regret Moves teach us what is possible, and what has value without risking a
thing. From there on, we can do small, slightly riskier, investments, with
Options and Hedges, and then we have to muster our courage, and do a Big Bet.

There is a trap in seeing no regret moves as incremental change only. No regret
moves also includes work that doesn't increment a thing. An experiment gives us
information about what is possible, what we or competitors might do in the
future, and what is around us, but doesn't necessarily move us forward.

# Don't miss opportunities

Discussing on the difference between incremental change and No Regret Moves
afterwards, Jamie said: "People who are timid favor incremental change, and may
miss big opportunities."

I have a tendency to be timid, maybe that is why I tend to favor incremental
change. I've got some work to do.
