# Big gains, need investment

Inner loop improvements can have a huge impact, they also require investment.
Becoming highly skilled at software development takes practice, training,
mentoring. Learning how do deliver running, tested software on shorter and
shorter loops is a hard skill.

Many organizations tend to underinvest, urging developers to focus on 'writing
software'. Or they see training mostly as an individual employment benefit with
limited training budgets. 

Training often seen as something for the individual, and as a fringe benefit (? "secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarde"). This misses the point of structurally improving the inner loop in a teams based environment.

Too many companies think “coaching” is a benefit they might offer under the learning &amp; development budget, when actually it is an existential concern for any technical team.

-> iets rondom ontwikkelen/groei van mensen

niet alleen iets vd individuen

ook v/u org

als je onvoldoende hierin investeert (tijd/geld) ga je het merken / betaal je de prijs

-> mensen leren toch, maar dan onder-begeleid, met vallen en opstaan, in productie code


individual learning vs group/team learning

+link to 4 types of knowledge: tacit en systemic
team training in dev skills heeft ook systemic effects
