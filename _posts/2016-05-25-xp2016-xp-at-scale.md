Elizabeth Hendrickson keynoting on eXtreme programming at scale, XP2016 Edinburgh. Elizabeth works as VP R&D for
Cloud foundry development at Pivotal.

Some numbers: 59 teams, 251 engineers 7 locations and a bunch of timezones.

eXtreme Programming is supported by the management team, because Rob Mee, one of the founders, was an early adopter, he reviewed the first edition of eXtreme Programming explained before it came out.

## Underlying principles

Breakfast and lunch together (I wonder how that works for people with kids, I like having some breakfast at home).

## Practices

Mostly the 12 original xp practices. works great for a single team. What about more teams. More information about the transition from the VMWare official process to xp in the pub ;-).

Tragedy of the commons: when a whole bunch of teams have a whole bunch of repos, and nobody has an incentive to fix any of it.

"without intervention, work rolls down hill". (picture of someone being chased down the hill by a big rock).

If XP is getting such good results, why is not everybody doing it? Because it requires fortitude. Every day we have to make decisions on how to deal with a thing. Are we going to decide to adopt a team branching policy, or are we going to take the pain and do continuous delivery with a massive number of teams. At the time it was just four, it takes fortitude to say we don't want inventory of unshipped features. A feature does not count until it is in the hands of the customer.

"Why are you having two people doing the work of one" never gots asked (on pair programming). The cliffhanger:

## We have 59 teams. Now what?

We have 59 teams of work rolling down hill. Underlying organizational principles:

- Use conways law to our advantage. Your code will resemble your organisation. Arrange teams according to desired architecture.
- Teams own things. No feature teams. Teams own their destiny.
- The team that owns the thing tests the thing. It is your responsibility. Nobody else is responsible for this. Not out of a sense of purity, but because it is also the team that has to fix the bugs they produce.
- Relentlessly improve feedback cycles.
- Increase empathy. "It would be very easy to create a blaming culture". It is painful to be in the field using something that works only in theory. Empathy is our strategic advantage.
- Coollaborate, not hand off ("with", not "for")


"At Cloud Foundry I became the queen of awkward conversations".

"External QA organizations don't work".
