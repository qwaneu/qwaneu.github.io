# rules for simple design

Code must be undertandable for the whole team (and other people and teams when
appropriate). Questions about 'what is this?' are an opportunity to improve the
design, not for defensiveness. We love having interns and new team members: They
ask innocent questions. This reveals assumptions we made when we wrote the code
that were invisible to us.

We had a debate about whether you could see this is embedded in (TODO link the
four rules of simple design) on twitter a long time ago. We find it important to
emphasize that code is, generally, written for an audience. 

Even if it is just you, do you stil understand code that you wrote last year?
