In 2018, we where involved in a project to develop a new product for one of our customers. In true [agile fluency 'optimizing' style](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html), the team, contained business, marketing, ux, product vision, and development. We had a simple goal, enter the market with this new product. We had some new insights on dimensional planning and estimating and achieving goals. 

> For obvious reasons, we have to apply some discretion on the projects story. we cannot share all the details. We'll try to share or experience as good as possible though and add some concrete examples from our current agile fluency diagnostic project.

For convenience, let's introduce some (not al and not all real) names for the people involved. Sarah, was our ambitious business owner, Rob, Magnus, and Wilbert the developers, Jelle our UX designer, Diana our our marketeer and Anton was our product owner.

We got involved in the project in february when some of the work was already done. Anton, Diana, Sara and Jelle, had created a user story map. And like often, the goals where set. An initial (beta) market release end of June, and a full release end of september.

We, developers took a week or two to get aquainted with the technology involved (some would call that spint 0) and then it withstarted to itch.

We had dates and lots of ambition, but I had this uncomfortable feeling, that we may not be able to achieve the plan. 

## problems that are tackled by DP

The customer wants it all and wants the best; you try to convince them that they will not need all the bells and whistles but the customer won't buy that. And you know only when the customer gets their hands on the software, they will understand what they really need.

A functionality/feature that "just does the job" is harder to sell


## origins of DP

Koen Van Exem; using it to sell fixed scope, fixed budget, fixed time projects 

Koen's intent for Dimensional Planning was to create a planning practice that makes planning both more predictable and adaptable, and to always have a shippable product on time.

'scope' is not a long fixed list of functionalities; such a list is usually a proxy for the actual value a customer is seeking, but the functionalities is his/her frame of thinking, much easier to articulate; that's not a customer flaw per se, as developers it is our job to help find the real underlying value

## the metaphor, by example


Dirt road - cobblestone road - highway


Dirt Road

Cobblestone Road

Highway


## Value of dimensional planning

Cobblestone: customer realization: "we don't need the Highway"

Looking at Value delivered/return on investment: realize value ealier

**The metaphor provides customer and developers with a language to discuss smaller valuable 'shippables'. It also makes the idea of 'good enough software product' more concrete.**

- Earlier ROI
- Reduce new product development risk
- Realize value/reach goals with less effort

## How does it relate to/mix with other techniques?

Link to User Story Mapping (http://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/) - link to ‘walking skeleton’ (note: slightly different from dirt road); DP is great way to define/slice releases in USM; helps in general as a decision support method for slicing, planning and finding minimal sets of work that deliver optimal expected value

Real Options
- using Dirt Road to test assumptions quickly; price of 'failure' is low (instead of putting all your bets on the most expensive one, the Highway) 

## Some of our experiences

a metaphor works well, especially when communicating with business (non-tech people)

you can adapt the metaphor to your own context a bit ("adding your own egg"), e.g. paper cup, coffee mug, silver chalice
