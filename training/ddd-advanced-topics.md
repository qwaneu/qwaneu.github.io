Domain Driven Design (DDD) connects stakeholders - users, business, developers - through shared language, connecting architecture and implementation to an evolving model of the problem domain. 

In our [Introducing DDD course](/training/ddd-introduction.md) we introduce DDD and its main modelling patterns and practices and our [Implementing DDD course](/training/implementing-ddd) covers translating a domain model into code. This course goes a step further and zooms in on two DDD architectural patterns that can help maintaining a grip on complexity and supporting scaling an application: Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing.

**Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** is a design pattern that separates handling commands and queries in an application. CQRS can lead to improved scalability, performance and maintenance.

**Event Sourcing** means storing the history of an application's state as a sequence of events. Instead of storing an aggregate's state, the state is dynamically derived from the events that have happened. This enables a more robust and fault-tolerant system. It also provides a clear audit trail, making it easier to recover from failures and facilitating reproducing faults when a system does not behave as expected.

## Goal

In this course, you will delve into CQRS and Event Sourcing, from concepts to code. Through a combination of theory and hands-on exercises, you will learn how to apply these patterns, including:

- separate write models and read models;
- create meaningful APIs;
- implement Event Sourcing to store events instead of current state;
- handle domain model evolution and versioning;
- optimize performance and concurrency control;
- create a view derived from an event journal.

By the end of this course, you will have a deep understanding of CQRS and Event Sourcing, including benefits, trade-offs and applicability of these patterns. You will be able to apply these concepts to your own projects to improve maintainability, scalability, and performance.

## Means

Through a mix of theory, hands-on programming exercises, and discussion, we will cover the patterns and their trade-offs. Applying Event Sourcing and CQRS requires for instance a higher initial investment. The benefits, e.g. replayable state or easier scaling, must be worth it in a particular situation. 

## Audience & prerequisites

Software developers, architects. This workshop is suitable both for junior developers who want to grow and for more senior developers whoâ€™d like to sharpen their skills. Programming experience is required for this workshop.

Prerequisites: participants should be familiar with DDD and its main patterns and they should know how these different patterns can be implemented in code. 
This is covered by these workshops:

- [Introduction to Domain Driven Design](/training/ddd-introduction.md)
- [Implementing Domain Driven Design](/training/implementing-ddd)
