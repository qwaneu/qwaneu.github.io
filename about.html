title: About QWAN
---
      <p>Whether we train, coach or develop, we’ll sit with you, analyze your situation and find a solution tailored to your context. We prefer techniques from agile and lean software development like Scrum, Kanban, eXtreme Programming, and test driven development, and we always keep an eye on the goal: delivering value-adding software.</p>

      <h3>Benefits of our approach</h3>

      <p>By working with us, our customers have reduced their time to market, while improving software quality. 
      This may seem like a paradox. We have found that by improving quality we can keep costs down and at the same time deliver faster. 
      Whenever customers get software that ‘just works’ they become happier, so they complain less and tell their friends. 
      Combined with a shorter time to market this means a better return on your investments. 
      You can use that money to reward investors, employees or taxpayers and find even better ways to develop software, so that the virtuous cycle continues</p>.

      <p>How we can uncover better ways depends on your context. 
      <a href="/#contact">Invite us for a conversation</a>
      and together we can find out what we can do for you. </p>

      <h3>Why the name QWAN?</h3>

      <p>The concept of Quality Without a Name is based on the work of the architect 
      <a href="http://www.patternlanguage.com">Christopher Alexander</a>
      , which has also been the inspiration for patterns in software development. 
      "Quality Without a Name" means that good quality is something you can recognise, but it is difficult to describe in words: you know it when you see it. 
      This names fits us, because we focus on improving ourselves and our profession continuously, and strive to deliver more value to our customers.</p>
