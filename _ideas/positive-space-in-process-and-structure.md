Concept of "Positive Space" (Alexander)

Processes and way of working: provide structure to how we work (as a team) and how we move towards our goals. 

How much space do these structures (like Scrum) leave? Is this remaining space well-structured or formless? Following Alexander's Positive Space, having the space between the structures well-formed/positive provides more life to the whole.

Example: meetings (with development team members) get scheduled at time when there is "room in their agenda". Meetings impose structure on the daily work, developers fit the development work (programming, thinking, collaborating, discussing) in the space between. But if this space between is not well-formed, it puts a drain on people. It feels like trying to get work done "between the meetings" or in spite of all the scheduled meetings. Make the non-meeting work more well-formed (how?)
