To get better insights in how a team can grow and what support they need from
their organization, we use the Agile FluencyÂ® model and associated tools. In
this post, we'll share how we run an Agile Fluency team diagnostic workshop and
how we use systems thinking techniques to arrive at recommendations for both the
team and management. 

We will show some examples from an actual diagnostic workshop we have ran with a
team, but we have blurred all confidential information. We assume the reader has
basic knowledge of the [Agile Fluency
model](https://www.agilefluency.org/model.php) and its zones.

# Engaging with management and the teams

We start out with a conversation with management, i.e. the people who have the
authority to decide on any investments the team needs. Together with management,
we decide on objectives for the team and an appropriate fluency zone: focusing,
delivering or optimizing.

Then we schedule and run a diagnostic workshop with the whole team. This
workshop is an extended team retrospective. Each team member individually fills
in a survey and we discuss the aggregated results together. The survey
consists of a number of method-agnostic statements about team behaviour. Each
team member indicates if the team shows that before on a scale from *Never* to
*Always*.

The aggregated results look like this:

![an example rollup chart showing the aggregated survey results for a team](/attachments/blogposts/2021/afd-rollups-example.jpg)

The coloured dots represent answers from different team members, the squares
marked green represent the consensus answer we arrive at together with the team.
It is not about perfect agreement, we aim for a good-enough answer indicative of
where the team currently is.

> The results do not represent the team's 'maturity'! Team growth is not a race to the top! 

This workshop gives us rich information on how fluent the team is in the
different capabilities required to get quality software out of the door now and
in the future. We use the information to provide feedback and directions for
growth. The workshop is a extended, guided self-assessment for the team and
allows us to provide much more specific directions for growth than what usually
comes out of a team retrospective.

> A diagnostic workshop has two kinds of output:
>- insights the participants gain themselves
>- our insights based on what we see and hear from the team and on our own experience

Looking at the results above, we see that not all consensus answers are marked
'Always' (the rightmost column). in other words, they are not fluent in
everything. This does not mean that they are a problematic team! On the
contrary, this team is doing quite well, delivering changes to production every
day with low defect rates. They still have opportunities however for further
growth.

# It's the conversation that matters

The exact survey answers are not that relevant, it is all about the
conversations that take place. The team has a conversation about how they work.
Sharing different perspectives and perceptions is already valuable. Many
teams we meet do not go that deep in their regular sprint retrospectives. 

The survey statements trigger deep conversations with and within the team. We
listen for signals - like someone saying "we have hardly any serious issues" -
and probe what is really going on. In a time span of two hours we get rich
information of how the team works and how it interacts with its context. Too
much to keep in our heads, so we make many notes, like this: 

![impression of the written and typed notes we take during a diagnostic workshop](/attachments/blogposts/2021/afd-notes-example.jpg)

Usually, we do not start giving advice or recommendations during the diagnostic
workshop. We have a good night's sleep and then try to make sense of it. We are
especially interested in any systemic effects at play, things that keep the
system the way it is and things that are self-reinforcing and could run out of
control. By taking a systemic perspective, we can find possible interventions
for the team and management that have more impact. It helps to go beyond
symptoms.

# Making sense of what's been said

To make sense of all the details, we use a technique called Diagrams of Effects,
from the field of systems thinking. In a diagram of effects, we map the system
in terms of variables and how these variables influence each other. We do this
together as pair-facilitators.

We start writing down candidate variables on post-its. A *variable* is something
that can increase or decrease, something that you can measure or observe in
practice. This is a diverging brainstorm activity, where we mostly note down
variables that we heard in the team conversation:

![initial brainstorm of variables with many post-its, in this case on a Miro board](/attachments/blogposts/2021/afd-many-postits.jpg)

Some examples of the variables we have identified for this team: 
- Smoothness of delivery to production
- Size of business increments
- Defects in CI/CD pipeline
- Clearness of Why & Value of work
- Time between delivery to production and finding a production issue
- Slow down by technical debt

In this example, the darker post-its represents variables related to the
Delivering zone, and the lighter ones are related to Focusing and Optimizing.

Then we get to the daunting task of finding relations between the variables. We
start drawing causal edges and challenge each other if this causal relationship
is really there, or if it is an indirect relation, i.e. we're missing a variable
in between. We merge duplicate variables, and discard some that do not add much:

![converging to a diagram of effects](/attachments/blogposts/2021/afd-converging.jpg)

Black edges indicate a *same* effect: if one variable goes up, the other also
tends to go up. Red edges indicate an *opposite* effect: if one variable goes
up, the other tends to go down.

We sometimes add an explanation or some themes we noticed (the purple notes in
this diagram). Or we add some benefits that are relevant for management and show
how these relate to the system (the green notes).

The diagram we create is not the truth! It represents how we (as facilitators)
perceive the system, based on what we heard from management and from the team,
what we heard between the lines, and on our own experience. We will not present
such a diagram as 'the way things are'. Instead, we use these diagrams to
illustrate how we see the system, and how we think the team can make more
effective steps for growth.

The diagram above is way to big and complicated, so we look for ways to
present it in a more manageable way. In this case, we noticed that there were
actually 3 systems in place. Of course, everything is connected, but splitting
it up in three smaller diagrams allows us to present our feedback in a more
focused way:

![split up the diagram into 3 smaller ones](/attachments/blogposts/2021/afd-splitting-up.jpg)

We have identified a number of self-reinforcing loops in the diagrams,
represented by the small snowballs.

> Having done fluency workshops with different teams in different organizations,
> we often see similar patterns recurring.

# An example pattern - handling technical debt

Let's have a look at one of the smaller diagrams. It is about handling technical
debt. 

![example diagram of effects about handling technical debt](/attachments/blogposts/2021/afd-techdebt-example.jpg)

We noticed a self-reinforcing loop: over time, more *Technical debt* means
*Long term maintainability* goes down, reducing *Smoothness of Delivery*. Lower
*Smoothness of Delivery* reduces *Forecast reliability*, which reduces the
organization's *Ability to steer* development initiatives. This lowers the
organization's *Trust in the team*, which negatively impacts the *quality of
both functional and technical decisions*. This increases *Technical debt*, and
so on.

A way of tackling this is reducing _technical debt as a project_. This requires
more visibility of technical debt in terms of short term and long term business
impact. Tackling technical debt as a project does have several disadvantages,
for instance increasing the length of development feedback loops. A technical
debt project tends to be complex and unpredictable, which impacts *Forecast
reliability* negatively. This is why we put a big **Beware!** in the diagram.
Although this way of tackling technical debt is not inherently bad, we find it
important to be aware of the downsides.

A different way of handling technical debt is *refactoring in (many) baby
steps*. By keeping the steps small, the team can get in a state where they are
continuously working on technical debt in a more predictable way, while having
sufficient time for other work as well. Tackling technical debt in this way
requires skills however. Working in tiny, highly controlled steps sounds simple
but is actually hard. A team needs practice time and possibly training and
mentoring to master this skill.

Note that when we present a diagram like this to a team as part of our feedback,
we will build it up in a number of steps, so that we can take the team along
with the story. 

# Considerations

When we report back to management, we sometimes create specific diagrams of
effects from a management perspective. Sometimes we reuse the diagrams we
shared with the team, but only if the team consents to that.

Diagrams of effects help to go beyond symptoms and find more effective
interventions. In addition, diagrams of effects are non-personal and
blameless. They shift the focus away from an individual's behaviour, to
systemic aspects, to how things are organized and how that affects behaviour.
This is in line with for instance Deming's statement that [90-95% of performance
is governed by the system](https://deming.org/dr-deming-called-for-the-elimination-of-the-annual-performance-appraisal/).

# Next steps

The feedback we provide to the team and to management is quite rich, so we let
them sleep on it. We meet up with the team to check up how it is going and help
identify experiments.
