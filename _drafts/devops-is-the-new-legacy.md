A couple of days ago, Jamie Dobson and Simon Wardley did a back to back presentation on [Cargo Cults and mapping DevOps and serverless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlPEeDWHy34&feature=youtu.be). 

Simon switches to DevOps the new legacy after next intro.

A utility: change something from exiting to boring.

Compute from product to utility causes co-evolution.

Inertia ('traditional' -> Next generation)

Past stuff not thrown out of the window, but co-opted (as devops and now cloud native do with agile).

"Refactoring has financial value". Observability of financial flows is slowly growing.

Emerging architectural value of serverless is expected by the map, but isn't there yet.

Serverless and cloud don't save money, they allow you to do more, because you
are in competition. If you don't move, you are going to have to spend more and
more just to keep up.. 10-15 year transitions. Evolution is made of thousands of
diffusion curves. 2024 to 2029 serverless is becoming the new norm. "Digital
transformation is saying you've discovered the internet."

climatic pattern: no choice on evolution. No custom-built everything, we depend
on lots of components, otherwise it would not be possible.

Red Queen effect: the need to keep moving, just to stand still.

1. execs have no situational awareness
2. if you're starting a cloud journey now, wait a couple of years and do
   serverless then.
3. "they think they are busy people."
4. Do you see any companies anticipate serverless (I built the world first
serverless environment in 2005). Big consultants killed it. You need to get the
timing right. Amazon, like the chinese government are good at finding the right
time to industrialize.
5. Jamie: who is going to change serverless into a racket. Who is going to
   benefit? Boring serverless. How are providers of the functions going to make
   money.

Existential threat / forcing function. The only pattern we have seen in every
cloud native transformation.
