Some tend to push their favorite practices.

People try something in their team, it works great, then they go out in the
world trying to sell everyone on that practice (yes, we did that too when we
started out with eXtreme Programming in the early 2000s)

But a practice fits in a context. It resolves specific forces in a specific context. So it is actually a pattern.

This holds for most of the 'good' things in software product development. Like:
a Definition of Done, Burndown/Burnup charts, story points. They are all
practices that resolve a set of forces in a context [@@quite abstract, need to
work this out for one or two of these practices, as an example!]

Without knowing or communicating explicitly the context and relevant forces,
considering or recommending a practice is not useful. It can even be harmful -
in case of a context mismatch, there can be all kinds of unintended
consequences. Although often, nothing happens and people just start to resent
the pattern, or start saying "this practice doesn't work".

This also means there are no best practices. Best means universally good
irrespective of context. If we seek 'best' i.e. universally applicable things,
these tend to be at a different level, more like principles. [Simon Wardley's
doctrine principles](https://learnwardleymapping.com/doctrine/) - standard ways
of operating and techniques that you almost always should apply - is a good
example. 

All these principles are at a higher abstraction level than something concrete
like a Definition of Done. This enables generativity for the principles
- fitting/applying it to your specific context.
