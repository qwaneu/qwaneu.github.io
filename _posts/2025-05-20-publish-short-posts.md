Sometimes I think: "this is not enough for a blogpost"; I&rsquo;ll make a LinkedIn post out of it. But maybe not. As a reader, my feed is like a firehose. For instance, I see a nice write-up from [Rob Bowley](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertbowley_technorealism-technorealist-activity-7330483672841601024-6iOD) or [Simon Wardley](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7330304449485107201/). Then after reading some of teh references, coming back to the timeline, the post has moved away ðŸ˜º.

In case you wonder, the same holds for non-algorithmic timelines - e.g. Mastodon. I can&rsquo;t even find my own messages back!

I would like to see some of your shorter writings as blog posts. So I can read and bookmark them in peace.

This is of course also about giving myself license to post shorter posts. I&rsquo;m editing some of my explorations in large language models into posts, and they are either long and meandering, or short. I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy a couple of short ones. And of course I also enjoy long posts, for instance this one [on how Jurgen Appelo use the theory of constraints to decide where to use LLMs for writing novels.](https://substack.jurgenappelo.com/p/humans-are-the-bottleneck) 

P.S. I needed to find links for Rob and Simon. I had my LinkedIn feed open for a few moments, and a post from Rob bubbled up, pointing to Simon. So a feed has upsides. But still. Write and publish that post on a blog somewhere!

P.S 2: Rob Bowley informed me that he has revived [robbowley.net](https://blog.robbowley.net). On medium, there is [Simon Wardley's blog](https://swardley.medium.com/).
