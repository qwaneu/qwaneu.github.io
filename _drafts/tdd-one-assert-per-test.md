We do not like long test scenarios with loads of different asserts. A test case
that has many expectations is difficult to understand when it fails. We then
have to dig inside the test's implementation to see what exactly went wrong
where. Before we know it, we fall in to a lengthy debugging session.

Our guideline is that a test should have one (and only one) reason to fail. Per
test we have a single assert or expectation. Sometimes it is more convenient to
have a few asserts, e.g. asserting multiple properties of the same thing. We
tend to regard this as conceptually one assert.

## Example - And, and, and  

Let's look at an example in Java, from an order processing application.

```java
public void savesOrderAndNotifiesOwnerIfPaid() {
  var order = aValidOrder()
                .with(aValidOrderItem("book").withPrice(20).build())
                .thatIsOpen()
                .build();
  var repository = mock(Orders.class);
  var notifier = mock(Notifier.class);
  var checkout = new CheckoutOrder(repository, notifier);
  checkout.execute(order);
  verify(repository).save(order);
  verify(notifier).notify("owner@x.com", orderNumber)
}
```

This test asserts (using [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) mocks) that an
order is saved in the repository _and_ a notification is sent out, using
`notifier`. These are two different expected outcomes.

This test might not look problematic at first. It is however harder to read and
more work to figure out what went wrong when it fails. In this case the test
name already hints we are covering two aspects. 

> *And* suggests there is a test on each side.

Asserting multiple things makes it hard to provide a meaningful name or description.

We prefer to split up this test into two separate tests. A literal split would suggest `savesOrder` and `notifiesOwnerIfPaid`,  but `IfPaid` is significant on the left to, so it becomes `savesOrderIfPaid`.

```java
// Preferably, we split them up:
public void savesOrderIfPaid() {
  ....
  verify(repository).save(order);
}
public void notifiesOwnerIfPaid() {
  ....
  verify(notifier).notify("owner@x.com", orderNumber)
}
```

We make sure our tests run fast, so an extra test won't affect our feedback loop
negatively. Using [test data builders](/2020/10/09/test-data-builders.html) like
we are doing in the example above helps us keep the setup per test short
and explicit.

We have seen worse examples of multiple asserts per test. 

# Example - All the contains

The following one is taken from [WeReview](https://wereviewhq.com), a conference
session management system we have developed. It is written in JavaScript, using
[Cypress](https://cypress.io) to drive a UI. Have a read through and make a note
about the different parts you recognize, and what they could possibly mean.

``` javascript
describe('Propose a session', () => {
    it('given I am administrator, when I create a CFS then I can propose a session, and I can see the submitted session', () => {
        cy.visit('/');
        login_as_administrator();

        const conferenceName = 'cypress test conference - admin login' // 1
        const conferenceCode = 'admin2029';
        cy.get('#shortCode').type(conferenceCode);
        cy.get('#displayName').type(conferenceName);
        cy.get('#addEvent').click();
        cy.contains('Data updated successfully');
        cy.contains(conferenceName).click();

        const fields = proposal_fields_one_presenter(conferenceCode); // 2
        const text_fields = fields.text_fields;
        fill_in_selects_and_text_fields(fields);
  
        cy.contains('Submit').click();
        cy.contains('Your session was saved');

        cy.visit(`/event/visiblesessions/${conferenceCode}`);  // 3
        cy.contains(text_fields["session-title"]).click();

        cy.contains(text_fields["session-title"]);            // 4
        cy.contains(text_fields.themes);
        cy.contains(text_fields["session-anything-else"]);
        cy.contains('Recording Permission');
        cy.contains('42'); // session cap
    });
});
```

If this test fails, it will take some effort to find out why it failed. We have
to trace the whole scenario up to the failing assert. The test description won't
help us much here. Cypress's interactive development tooling will help identify
the failing test, but it still takes time. And when we run the test in a CI
environment, we still have to find the failing line. A _wandering test_ like
this hampers the quick feedback loop we crave from our automated tests.

Let's compare our notes. There are ten instances of`cy.contains`, so ten
asserts? But wait, there is more! each ` cy.get` and `cy.visit`are also
assertionss. If the target for `get` is missing, or visiting `cy.visit`'s
destination fails, the test fails too. This is a feature in Cypress, and it
should encourage us to focus our test more closely.

We can distinguish four conceptual blocks:

1. *Given* we are administrator, *When* we create a conference, *Then* we get a success confirmation and we can navigate to the 'organise' page for that conference.
2. *Given* a session idea, *When* we propose it, *Then* we get confirmation of successful receipt
3. *Given* I am an administrator, *When* there is a session proposal, *Then* I can visit it
4. *Given* I am an administrator, *When* I visit the session proposal's page, *Then* I can see all the values entered by the proposer.

The first block still has two _and_s, but we are making progress. Baby steps.

Naming these parts also suggests tests are less thorough than they could be.
Instead of 'all the values entered by the proposer' for example, we are checking
a sample. 'All the values' is significant, because not all roles are allowed to
see all the values.
 
What can we do about this test? As in the first example, we need to split it up
in order to get to one (conceptual) assert.

We can apply the *Given-When-Then* pattern: In this test, each assert is a
'then', with a corresponding 'when' just before it. We can pull out the
then+when into a separate test, and set up the object under test (the Given) in
the appropriate state. 


# What can help against wandering tests

Some things that are helpful against wandering tests are:

- [Test data builders](/2020/10/09/test-data-builders.html)
- Extract Method refactorings

![assertsMany.jpg](/attachments/blogposts/2021/tdd/assertsMany.jpg)
{: class="post-image post-image-50" }

Let's see what one or more extract method refactorings could provide us here.

## Wishful thinking

Spitting the test like this is quite a lot of work to do. Let's take a seemingly
simple one, number 2: 

***Given* a session idea, *When* we propose it, *Then* we get confirmation of successful receipt**

``` javascript
describe('When I Propose a session', () => {
     // Given remains wishful 
    it('Then I get get confirmation of success', () => {
        const fields = proposal_fields_one_presenter(conferenceCode); 
        const text_fields = fields.text_fields; // 1
        fill_in_selects_and_text_fields(fields);
        cy.contains('Submit').click();
        cy.contains('Your session was saved');
```

Now we spot opportunities for better readability. The line marked with `// 1` is
redundant for this test. But we can't refactor that, because _we are not on
green_. We are missing the Given.

After some discussion, we sketched and executed the following:

``` javascript
function given_a_conference({conferenceCode, conferenceName}) {
        cy.visit('/');
        login_as_administrator();
        cy.get('#shortCode').type(conferenceCode);
        cy.get('#displayName').type(conferenceName);
        cy.get('#addEvent').click();
        cy.contains('Data updated successfully');
        cy.contains(conferenceName).click();
} 

describe('When I Propose a session', () => {
    const conferenceName = 'cypress test conference - admin login'
    const conferenceCode = 'admin2029';
    const given_a_session_idea = proposal_fields_one_presenter;

    before(() => {
        given_a_conference({conferenceCode, conferenceName});
    });
    it('Then I get confirmation of success', () => {
        const fields = given_a_session_idea(conferenceCode);
        fill_in_selects_and_text_fields(fields);

        cy.contains('Submit').click();
        cy.contains('Your session was saved');
    });
});
```

We found out that the wishful *given* was a given that we overlooked - we need a
conference. Extracting `given_a_conference` affords us the opportunity to change
that later, so it makes a conference available without going through the UI.
There was a `create_conference` function already, but that didn't quite do what
we need here. Choosing this name also gives us the option to reuse a conference
for multiple tests.

The other thing that jumped out, now there is less code, was that
`proposal_fields_one_presenter` is an implementation detail. We don't really
care what is filled in, as long as it is a valid proposal. Having taken a step
back with our four-way split, we  ee this can play the role of `Given a
session idea`. 

``` javascript
    const given_a_session_idea = proposal_fields_one_presenter;
```

We do a bit of functional programming and assign the detailed function to a
different name in the test's `describe` block.

There is still some implementation-ish stuff left, but we believe the test has
moved forward in readability.

## Effects

Thinking _one (conceptual) assert per test_ helps us in creating short, focused tests that will provide specific feedback when failing.

Focusing on a single assert will help us see code that is doing too much: the
issue might not be that the test wants to assert two things, but the fact that
the code under test is doing two things. Can/should we refactor the code?

## Further reading

The _One Assertion Per Test_ rule [was originally coined back in 2004](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=35578) by eXtreme Programmer Dave Astels (of [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) fame).

The *Given-When-Then* way of structuring tests comes from Dan North and Chris
Matts, who [introduced the concept of Behaviour Driven Development
(BDD)](https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/) in the early 2000s. 

The book [Formulation, Document examples with Given/When/Then](https://leanpub.com/bddbooks-formulation) by Seb Rose and GÃ¡spÃ¡r Nagy goes more in detail on how to write readable Given/When/Then specs.
