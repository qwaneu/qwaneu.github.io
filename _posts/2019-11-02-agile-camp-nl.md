Rob and I participated in the brand new [Agile Camp NL conference](https://agilecamp.nl/), a open-space-y conference on agile. 
Kudos to Karlijn Moll & [Thomas van Zuijlen](https://thomasvanzuijlen.nl/) for running the conference and creating such a nice atmosphere! 

We ran two sessions, the slides are available as PDFs:

- Example Mapping workshop - [slides](/attachments/example-mapping.pdf)
- Promise is Debt (taking a systems view on agile development) - [slides](/attachments/promise-is-debt.pdf)

The story of Promise is Debt is also available as a [booklet](/attachments/qwan-systems-book.pdf).
