A liveblog of Don Reinertsens' Agile Cambridge keynote

"Have you received messages telling you that variabilty is bad?"

There is a tendency in software development to think in binary - either hate variability of love it.

If I have high variabilty going into the black box, I have low projects coming out.

There is a long war on variability:

* Zero defects
* repeatability in CMMI
* Lean Manufacturing
* estimating methods of Scrum
* Lean Kanbans' interest in Statiscal Process Control

"But as we know, not all wars are based on sound reasoning"
