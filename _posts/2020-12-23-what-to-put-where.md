Deciding What To Put Where is half of the work of software development. What
should I put where, in such a way that me and my colleagues will be able to
find it back later? Finding a good place for things in code greatly helps or
hinders maintainability of the code later on.

Knowing what to put where is a skill developed through practice. Things
that can be helpful are looking at code through a Hexagonal Architecture lens,
making 'things' in your code explicit through types or classes,
designing with CRC cards, pair programming, and documentation.

## Knowing What To Put Where

An important part of our job as software developers is taking design decisions
at all levels: sketching a high level architecture on a whiteboard, where we
decide which responsibility goes where; CRC (Class Responsibility Collaborators)
design sessions, where we play out scenarios of object interactions, to see
which object will have which responsibility; and at the micro-level, like
deciding on names for specific operations.

We are not only trying to make the software work for now, we intend to develop
in a sustainable way. Therefore we are continuously thinking "what concern
should we put where?" We spend much more time navigating, reading and
understanding code than writing it. Whenever we need to make changes, we'd like
to find out quickly where we should be, and we hope that the concern to be
changed is in one and only one place.

How do we decide What To Put Where? We do not have generic rules or best
practices, but we do apply numerous design heuristics. It is a skill you learn
through (deliberate) practice. So let's have a look at two examples, to share
our considerations about what should be put where. The examples are from our
work on the online [Agile FluencyÂ®
Diagnostic](https://www.agilefluency.org/diagnostic.php) application.

## Adding CSV export

In the Online Agile Fluency Diagnostic application, we show a colourful
aggregated view of team survey results (the 'rollup chart'). We decided to make
the aggregated data available for download in CSV format (Comma Separated
Values), so that our users can process it with their own tools.

In our back-end component, we already had the following:
- a domain object `Rollup` with logic to aggregate survey data
- an HTTP GET route to expose the Rollup data (part of the adapters ring
  of our component)
- a function that maps the Rollup object to JSON data (in the same module as the route code)

Where do we put a CSV export? We regard it as another view on the Rollup domain
object. Looking through the [Hexagonal
Architecture](/2020/08/20/hexagonal-architecture.html) lens, it does not affect
the domain logic, so we do not need any changes there. It is an _adapter_
concern: it is about translating a domain object to a different format on a
different endpoint.

![fitting in CSV export into the architecture](/attachments/blogposts/2020/wtpw-csv.jpg)
{: class="post-image post-image-50" }

We added an endpoint and a function that maps a `Rollup` object to text lines in
CSV format. A bit of work on the front-end component was required as well, to
add a download button.

As a result, whenever we need to change or add data in the CSV we know exactly
where to find it: it is an adapter concern, part of our routing code.

The CSV conversion including headings is currently a single function, 8 lines of
Python. Maybe someday, we'd like to have more fancy CSV output, and we might
find that 'CSV' is a thing of itself. In that case we'll probably extract a
class for it.

## Internationalization
 
We wanted to offer the Agile Fluency team survey in different languages, where
the facilitator selects a specific language for a diagnostic workshop. The
original survey is in English, and our colleague facilitators had been working
on German and Spanish translations. Having the team survey available in multiple
languages makes the online application much wider applicable.

In our Vue.js front-end, we decided to use the
[VueI18N](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) library. We created a file with
translations and fed this to `VueI18N`, which plugs itself into UI components.
It seemed all pretty straightforward and initially, we thought that language and
locale related stuff should be put in the UI components.

The survey contents is not part of the front-end, but comes from the back-end.
We extended our back-end with multiple survey translations in YAML format and
made the code select the right translation based on the chosen team workshop
language.

When creating a diagnostic session, we let the facilitator select a language
from a list of languages. The `NewDiagnosticSession` UI component ([which we
wrote about in an earlier post](/2020/09/25/hexagonal-frontend-example.html))
gets the available languages from the back-end.

When the front-end Survey component retrieves a survey, it needs to set its
language to the survey language, so that the accompanying instructions show up
correctly. Some logic around `VueI18N` started to grow in the Survey UI
component.

Because a facilitator shares the rollup chart view with the team, the rollup
chart should also be shown in the correct language. We had to add some
conditional logic in a router hook to ensure the current language gets reset
when needed. 

Hm, it does not smell good...we see more and more knowledge about languages and
`VueI18N` spread around our code base...

![I18N creating a mess in our architecture](/attachments/blogposts/2020/wtpw-i18n-1.jpg)

Multiple UI components contain translation logic and depend on the
`VueI18N` library. Our domain knows about the current language and how `VueI18N`
works. Our `main.js` has  intimate knowledge about how `VueI18N` works... We had
code like this in UI components:

```javascript
    this.diagnostic.retrieveQuestions(this.sessionId, this.participantId).then(() => {
      this.$i18n.locale = this.diagnostic.language
    })
```

Our UI components start acting as a
[Mediator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern) between our domain
code and `VueI18N`. We followed the Hexagonal Architecture principle of keeping
frameworks outside, preventing `VueI18N` dependencies in our domain code, but
now our UI components are getting messy.

> Survey language is a cross cutting concern in this application. We cannot
isolate it completely. Both front-end and back-end will have knowledge of survey
language.  
> **The question is not how to remove this knowledge as much as possible, but
rather how to minimize what each part _really_ needs to know to do its job.**  
> In the back-end, we know the language of a diagnostic session and we select an
appropriate survey translation. We also select a
translation for invitation emails, but there is no other language-based logic.

Reflecting on what we had created, we realised we missed a domain concept and an
adapter in the front end. `VueI18N` is closely related to Vue.js based UI
components, but the concept of available languages and a current language is a
concern of its own. Hence we introduced a **Language Store** concept for this,
which is implemented by a `I18nBasedLanguageStore` adapter encapsulating
`VueI18N` dependencies.

Once we had introduced the language store, we suddenly had a place to put all
language related stuff: selecting the current language, knowing available
languages, resetting the current language. Our domain code can now _decide_ on
the language, but it does not need to know how it works out in the UI. The
domain code delegates to the Language Store, which handles the details. We have
moved the language logic from the UI components to the Language Store.

## Things that help in deciding what to put where

- **Use Hexagonal Architecture as a lens** - [Hexagonal
  Architecture](http://localhost:8082/2020/08/20/hexagonal-architecture.html) provides a frame of reference to designate
  different concerns in a system as ports, adapters, or domain logic, and it
  helps with structuring dependencies.
- **Introduce a name for the 'thing'**. We can do this either by design or
  discovery. Whenever we find ourselves fiddling with for instance a string in
  several places in the code, this string apparently means something. We look
  for a good name and create a type for it. Having a thing represented by a name
  creates a place in the code where related logic and responsibilities want to
  go. Duplicated code or is usually a strong indicator that there is a 'thing'
  to be discovered.
- **Ask 'Who needs to know what? Can reduce that knowledge?'** The more an
  object or function knows, the more coupled it is and the more sensitive it is
  to changes. And the more code we will need to touch if there is a change. In
  our I18N example, both front-end and back-end know the language of a
  diagnostic session. Only the front-end needs to know about the _current_
  language, the back-end should not care.
- **Working with CRC (Class, Responsibilities, Collaborators) cards for rapid
  design feedback**. [CRC cards](http://c2.com/doc/oopsla89/paper.html) are a
  lo-fi technique to quickly create a model of objects and their
  responsibilities on cards. It enables us to play out alternative scenarios and
  get a feel for how the design works out. It provides good feedback on which
  object needs to know what.
- **Pair programming or ensemble programming** - collaboratively doing
  design, having a good discussion together about what is the nature of the
  'thing' and where it does belong. Taking time to nitpick about the right place
  is worthwhile, it will probably save us and our future colleagues many hours
  of wandering through the code to find the lines to change.
- **Test Driven Development As If You Meant It** - [TDD As If You Meant
  It](https://cumulative-hypotheses.org/2011/08/30/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it/) is a
  more extreme form of Test Driven Development, originally proposed by Keith
  Braithwaite as a workshop technique. With TDD As If You Meant It you let your
  code grow in the test and only extract a function or class when the code asks
  for it by showing duplication. This technique turns out to be useful for
  discovering 'things' in legacy code as well. Our tests can be a haven of tiny green fields in a see of brown.
- **Documentation** helps too, e.g [Readme Driven
  Development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
  or a high level description of what goes where on a wiki. It helps if we have
  standard places at least for the main concerns, and we stick to that. 

## Learn what to put where

"How can I learn more about what to put where?" a participant recently asked in
our refactoring workshop. There are no best practices or simple lists, it is
about skills and design heuristics. So what _can_ you do?

- Practice, lots of practice, **deliberate practice**.
- **Practice together** - run frequent team sessions to practice, e.g. in the
  form of [coding dojos](https://codingdojo.org/) or [ensemble programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mob-programming/). By putting the code
  under a magnifying glass and nitpicking together, you will learn a lot, and
  have a great time!
- Try out **alternatives and small experiments**, whenever you can. Yes, also
  when you're working on production code, when sketching designs on a whiteboard
  or doing a CRC session.
- **Test Driven Development** is a discipline of software development that helps
  in making you continuously think about what to put where. We recommend the
  [Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by
  Tests](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4268826-growing-object-oriented-software-guided-by-tests)
  book by Nat Pryce & Steve Freeman.
- **Read the [99 Bottles of OOP e-book](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles)** by
  Sandi Metz. This book is about learning Test Driven Development and Object
  Oriented Design, and guides you through different design consideration with
  concrete examples. Highly recommended!
- Teach yourself **the language of Code Smells and Refactorings**. Code Smells
  provide a vocabulary of things that can be improved in code. Mastering
  this vocabulary will give you a richer perspective on your code. Refactorings
  provide you a vocabulary of small, well defined design improvements.
- Learn about **Connascence**. [Connascence](https://connascence.io/) is a more
  formal model of different dimensions of coupling in code. It offers a powerful
  perspective on dependencies - who needs to know what and what else needs to
  change if I change this? 
- **Don't be afraid to make wrong choices**. Learning how to refactor away
  from your previous, not-so-good decisions is much more powerful than trying to
  learn to do things first time right. The more skilled you get in programming
  yourself out of corners, the less risky wrong design decisions become and the
  more you are able to learn, and the more... see the virtuous cycle here?
