Working as a consultant, facilitator and coach has taught me the subtle art of *not* intervening. However simple non-intervening sounds, it is quite difficult to put into practice. 

We tend to intervene because that is what we're trained in and what (we feel) we are paid for. But intervening too much will not bring the change we intend. In fact, it will enable the system to continu its current behaviour while you are getting exhausted. Minimizing interventions gives us space to understand and feel the system, and focus on those few things that do have a lasting effect.

## Born (and paid) to intervene

As consultants, agile coaches, scrum masters, mentors we tend to **do** things: help teams, talk to individuals, lead a group through a process.
Being process minded, we are interveners by trade right? Intervening is our job! Facilitators like to facilitate. Or at least we are paid to intervene, right?

As an external consultant paid by the hour, it is sometimes even worse - we feel we should be acting - that's what they pay us for right? They don't pay us for not doing anything and just sitting on our hands...

## Open space conference as a minimalist intervention

Many years ago, Willem and I created the Agile Open conference series,
exploring Open Space Technology to run a participant-driven conference. Running
open spaces has been an exploration in how little facilitation a group needs to let great interactions happen. We haved moved towards minimalism: focusing on the small set of rules and principles from Open Space, setting up the
spaces, and bringing ourselves to the floor. Besides that we let participants
work out stuff by themselves. 

We found very little intervention was needed. Setting the initial conditions and then
intervening as little as needed helped participants take ownership of
the process, and make the event work for them.

We have noticed some other open space facilitators in the agile community trying to control quite a few details of the event process and group dynamics,
e.g. intervening as soon as a question arises when participants are co-creating the
program on the wall. Our experience is that people will figure it out without intervention. In fact, intervening too soon will reinforce the pattern of participants relying on the facilitator to solve things for them.

## A systemic perspective

let's take systemic view and see teams, groups, organizations as systems: the goal of a system is what it does. Its current behaviour is following the path of least resistance. Metaphorically, it flows like water through the landscape as shaped by the system and its contexts.

Continuously intervening in a system means continuously putting energy in. It is like you are redirecting the water flow with your bare hands". This sounds like a tiring thing to do (and it is!)

Before we know it, our interventions start compensating for the undesired behaviour instead of structurally changing the system. By our actions, we actually allow the system to sustain its current behaviour rather than change.

Too much intervention does not help and it will eventually exhaust you.

## Interventions can weaken a system

Doing interventions in a team or an organization can have short-term positive
effects, but on the longer term, it can weaken the system. A team can grow
dependent on the consultant to fix things, to compensate for dysfunctional
patterns. 

The consultant becomes an indispensable part of the system to be
effective - "you have become an essential barrier redirecting the flow". The longer this happens, the more difficult it becomes to leave, and
the more impactful leaving will be.

It is like Gerald M. Weinberg already described 35 years ago in his Secrets of Consulting book as "Marvin's First and Second Great Secrets":

> "Ninety percent of all illness cures itself - with absolutely no intervention from the doctor. Deal gently with systems that should be able to cure themselves."

> "Repeatedly curing a system that can cure itself will eventually create a system that can't."

## Not intervening

So don't *re*act directly; take a step back; take a deep breath. What happens if you don't intervene directly? Can they solve it themselves? What questions would be helpful in the situation?

Friction, tension, conflict is part of a change process; often these are symptoms of something else. It's the system trying to tell you something. Techniques like co-creating a [diagram of effects](http://localhost:4000/2022/04/06/team-fluency-feedback-with-systems-thinking.html) or using [Moving Questions](https://www.movingquestions.com/the-5-questions-that-unlock-movement-when-nothing-else-works) can help to learn more about the real underlying dynamics. This can help see interventions that do have a more lasting effect. Or see that no intervention is needed.

Our reactions are interventions that tend to row against the stream. Instead, get a feel for the dispositional state of the system and affordance of the context it is in. These give insight into what behaviour and direction is likely and unlikely for the system in its current state, or in other words, what shapes the paths of least resistance. Several methods from [Cynefin]() can be helpful here, like [Estuarine Mapping]().

A side benefit of not intervening is that you buy yourself time and peace. This is especially valuable in a turbulent context where everyone is busy and running to stand still. Even though such a system invites you to run along, staying calm will be your superpower.
