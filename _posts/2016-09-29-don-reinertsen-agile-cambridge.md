A liveblog of Don Reinertsens' Agile Cambridge keynote

"Have you received messages telling you that variabilty is bad?"

There is a tendency in software development to think in binary - either hate variability of love it.

If I have high variabilty going into the black box, I have low projects coming out.

There is a long war on variability:

* Zero defects
* repeatability in CMMI
* Lean Manufacturing
* estimating methods of Scrum
* Lean Kanbans' interest in Statiscal Process Control

"But as we know, not all wars are based on sound reasoning"

## Today we like to minimize variability

under commit, pad buffers to reduce variability.

Six Sigma - make choices that have low variability. Innovation introduces uncertainty in outcomes, uncertainty raises variability. It was introduced in 3M. 3M tracked which products were generating revenue. After Six Sigma, annual reports showed a drop from 60 to 40 to 30 percent, and then they stopped reporting, until ... (McErnie?) left.
