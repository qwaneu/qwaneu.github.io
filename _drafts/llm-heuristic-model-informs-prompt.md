It can work surprisingly well to ask a Large Language model what it can do, or how to best ask it questions.
The emphasis is on _surprisingly_ - no guarantees, we are playing with randomness after all. They will all tell you something different, and you can use that to your advantage.

While trying to get useful results out of [my happy shallow research accident](), I was unsure for how to best prompt the model to use the tools I had made available to it: searching the web, and fetching urls.

Model Informs Prompt 
===

TODO expand on introduction *prompts are iterative*. The things I ask models changes over time, as I consciously or not, add to the Heuristics I use, and my understanding of what particular tools and models are good at.

Examples:

* How can I best ask you a question?

Making the first one more specific with *topic*:

- How can I best ask you a *refactoring* question?. 

The answer will be different from one model to the next. This a fun exercise, and often 


Sometimes these prompts deliver bland results. For instance, asking my go-to local model `mlx-community/Qwen3-30B-A3B-8bit` 'How can I best ask you programming questions?** was not necessarily super insightful, but the common pitfalls were kind of interesting:

>> **7. Avoid Common Pitfalls**
   - Donâ€™t just post a code snippet and say "It doesnâ€™t work.**  
   - Avoid asking for entire solutions without showing your own effort.  
   - Donâ€™t ask for help with homework or assignments unless youâ€™ve already tried solving it yourself.

It is the kind of thing you might read on stack overflow as a recommendation. I don't think the model cares if you have put in any effort, or if it is a homework assignment! But saying more than "it doesn't work" does tend to help, encouring the model (in the instruction) 

Let the model tell you what it can do

What are you good at?_ Often gives me good results. I used a variation of this prompt with [local model](TODO link)

This was fun. I copied it somewhere - is it in the qwen3 repo? No, but the llm tool will have the history **TODO find prompt explanation**

The question was not about asking questions, or generic what can you do. I was trying to figure out how to get the model to search (TODO link to agentic search**  2025/05/01/agentic-search.html

**TODO*** put the headings in a quote block, as they work as a brief explanation for things to think about when prompting. And they work for a variety of tasks.

Thinking and doing

I wasn't a big fan of the 'thinking' models initially, it was unclear to me what they were for. But the mixed models, let's call them *thinking and doing models* make that fun. With a streaming client, you can see interpretations of your prompt forming, giving multiple perspectives on a few sentences you wrote. Hosted models now offer a 'thinking under the hood' UI, where you can open it to show the thinking as you wait for an outcome.

To best leverage my agentic capabilitiesâ€”my ability to act autonomously, make decisions, and pursue goals effectivelyâ€”you can structure your 
interactions around clarity, specificity, and iterative refinement. Hereâ€™s how to maximize this:

---

### **1. Define Clear Goals and Parameters**
   - **Be specific**: Clearly state your objective (e.g., "Write a 500-word blog post on climate change solutions" vs. "Write something about climate 
change").
   - **Set constraints**: Specify formats, tone, length, or tools (e.g., "Use bullet points, include 3 sources, and avoid jargon").
   - **Example**:  
     *"Generate a 10-step plan to reduce household energy consumption, focusing on cost-effective solutions. Include a budget-friendly checklist and a 
3-month timeline."*

---

### **2. Break Complex Tasks into Smaller Steps**
   - Agentic systems excel at **task decomposition**. For example:
     - **Research**: "Find 5 peer-reviewed studies on AI ethics published in the last 3 years."
     - **Analysis**: "Summarize the key findings of these studies and identify 3 common ethical concerns."
     - **Synthesis**: "Create a presentation slide deck outlining these concerns and potential solutions."

---

### **3. Use Iterative Refinement**
   - Start with a rough draft or initial plan, then refine it:
     - *"Draft a marketing email for a new product. Then, revise it to emphasize urgency and include a call-to-action."*
   - Provide feedback to guide the process:  
     *"This draft is too technical. Rewrite it for a general audience with simpler language."*

---

### **4. Leverage Autonomy for Decision-Making**
   - Let me **choose the best approach** when possible:
     - *"Plan a 5-day trip to Japan. Prioritize budget-friendly options and include local cultural experiences."*
     - *"Design a logo for a tech startup. Use modern fonts and a color scheme that conveys innovation."*
   - For creative tasks, I can generate multiple options and let you choose.

---

### **5. Combine with External Tools**
   - If your task requires external data or tools (e.g., coding, data analysis, or real-time info), I can:
     - **Generate code** (e.g., Python scripts, SQL queries).
     - **Explain technical concepts** (e.g., "How does a neural network work?").
     - **Simulate processes** (e.g., "Model a supply chain optimization problem").

---

### **6. Focus on Problem-Solving**
   - Use me to tackle complex problems by breaking them into logical steps:
     - *"Solve this math problem: A car travels 60 mph for 2 hours, then 40 mph for 1.5 hours. Whatâ€™s the total distance?"*
     - *"Debug this Python code: [insert code]. Explain the error and provide a fix."*

---

### **7. Creative and Strategic Tasks**
   - **Content creation**: Write stories, scripts, or social media posts.
   - **Strategic planning**: Develop business strategies, marketing campaigns, or academic research plans.
   - **Learning and teaching**: Explain concepts, create study guides, or generate practice problems.

---

### **8. Ethical and Safe Use**
   - I operate within **ethical and safety guidelines**. For example:
     - I wonâ€™t generate harmful, unethical, or illegal content.
     - Iâ€™ll flag ambiguous or risky requests (e.g., "How to hack into a system").

---

### **Examples of Agentic Use Cases**
   - **Automate repetitive tasks**: "Organize my email inbox by priority and flag important messages."
   - **Research and analysis**: "Summarize the latest trends in AI healthcare applications and highlight 3 breakthroughs."
   - **Decision support**: "Compare 3 project management tools and recommend the best for a remote team."

---

### **Tips for Effective Interaction**
   - **Be precise**: Avoid vague requests. Instead of "Help me with my project," say, "I need a 10-page research paper on renewable energy policies in 
the EU. Include 5 sources and a bibliography."
   - **Provide context**: Share background info to help me align with your goals.
   - **Ask follow-up questions**: If the initial output isnâ€™t perfect, ask for refinements (e.g., "Can you rephrase this section to be more 
persuasive?").

---

### **When to Use Agentic Capabilities**
   - For tasks requiring **autonomy**, **complex reasoning**, or **multi-step execution**.
   - When you want to **delegate** parts of a project to the AI while maintaining oversight.
