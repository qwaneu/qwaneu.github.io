When visiting clients and talking about the architecture of their software systems, we often notice that people conflate different concerns under the term 'architecture'.
They tend to mix logical conserns with deployment concerns. Examples of*logical concerns* would be domain logic, domain dynamics, and how these are connected. *Deployment concerns* can be for instance REST APIs, components, microservices, and lambdas.
The cloud native movement has made this even worse, especially with serverless infrastructure concepts.

An example of this is the post on [What a typical 100% Serverless Architecture looks like in AWS](https://medium.com/serverless-transformation/what-a-typical-100-serverless-architecture-looks-like-in-aws-40f252cd0ecb) by Xavier LefÃ¨vre.
The post gives a nice view into some of the architecture and infrastructure decisions they made. The diagram in the post however talks AWS lambdas, S3 buckets, API gateway, etc.
This architecture view is not about the domain concepts and how they relate (they talk a bit about it in the text). Neither does it focus on how business logic is mapped onto the infrastructure concepts.
The view presented is a deployment view, not a logical view of the application.

## Views on software systems

I am not saying this view on an application is wrong. On the contrary, I find [the 100% serverless post](https://medium.com/serverless-transformation/what-a-typical-100-serverless-architecture-looks-like-in-aws-40f252cd0ecb) insightful in how they are using the serverless infrastructure concepts and how all the services in the infrastructure are connected.
It is however just one of many views on a software system. For any non trivial software system, we need multiple views, to make the complexity manageable for us.
Multiple views enable us to makie trade-offs about:

* business rules,
* how concepts work together,
* how everything is mapped onto infrastructure.

_Mapping onto_ is key here - we start from what we want, and map that on the infrastructure we can get. Sometimes we let cool infrastructure inspire us, but we always go back to our wants and the user needs.

## An example

Let's look at an example, loosely based on a project we worked on some time ago. The system is a web shop. One of the back end components processes product orders.
This component creates/stores/retrieves orders from a relational database; it also offers order overview with full text search option, and the possibility to export of orders per time period (up to a year).
For the search and export, an Elastic Search based index was used.

All three functionalities were closely related, being about the same Order [Aggregate](@@link to some DDD goodness). Seen through the [hexagonal architecture lens](/2020/08/20/hexagonal-architecture.html), it looks like this:

![order processing, search and export in a single component, seen through a hexagonal architecture lens](/attachments/blogposts/2020/log-dep-view-hex-1.jpg)

The red 'A's are the primary and secondary adapter, REST controllers, SQL database adapters, and Elastic Search adapters in this case.

One of the architecture principles we followed was that each component is responsible for its own data storage, which amounts to no shared logical databases between components and no inter-component coupling via the database.

Initially this component was deployed as a single unit.
Then we started noticing some issues with the component.
The different functionalities turned out to have quite different runtime characteristics:
- Exports are run only a few times a month, but when running they have a very high CPU and memory demand; this sometimes caused the component to be unavailable, impeding the primary business process of order processing.
- Sometimes complex search queries triggered heavy processing in the component, reducing responsiveness of the component, again affecting the primary process.

The component was split it into 3 components: order processing, search and export, and they were put in separate git repositories.
We introduced shared libraries to handle the dependencies between the code bases.

![order processing, search and export as three components](/attachments/blogposts/2020/log-dep-view-hex-split-in-3.jpg)

The 3 components got their own deployment parameters: the export component can be a single instance with a lot of memory, the order processing component can be configured for auto scaling during busy times, etc.

> But now we have 3 components that are tightly coupled. They have some "interesting" dependencies across the components, as indicated by the dotted lines.
> The components also share databases, so violate our architecture principles...or not? Did we create a mess or...?

We have one view combining  dependencies, logical coupling, and runtime issues. Because these different concerns get all mixed up, things get unnecessarily complicated.

## Taking a fresh view

What happened? We did a logical split of a component because of deployment/runtime concerns.
Let's take a different perspective on this: logically we can continue to see it as a single coherent component that has one codebase, one git repository.
We have some coupling here, but it is local to this codebase so acceptable/manageable. So we are back at the initial architecture drawing:

![order processing, search and export in a single component, seen through a hexagonal architecture lens](/attachments/blogposts/2020/log-dep-view-hex-2.jpg)
{: class="post-image post-image-70" }

This is the **logical view** of our order processing subsystem.

We can create three deployables from this single logical component, to accommodate for the different runtime characteristics.
This allows us to better balance the different architectural concerns, like coupling/cohesion and runtime performance, scaling.

![deployment view with databases and 3 order processing deployables](/attachments/blogposts/2020/orders-deployment-view.jpg)
{: class="post-image post-image-70" }

This is the **deployment view** of our order processing subsystem.

So by separating the two views, we can discuss logical concerns and deployment/runtime concerns separately. This allows us to make better trade-offs.
By deploying a single logical component as multiple deployment units, we need to prevent compatibility issues during deployment:
for instance when the export is already the new version and order processing is still the old version. In this situation however, the benefit of allowing different runtime characteristics outweighs these costs.

## This is not a new idea

We did not invent this idea of having different perspectives or views on your system's architecture.
It has been around for quite some time and we'd like to mention a few of our sources of inspiration.

### 4+1 Architecture View Model

Philippe Kruchten's [4+1 Architecture View Model](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/teaching/papers/4+1view-architecture.pdf) (PDF) dates from 1995.
This model distinguishes the Logical View, the Process View, the Development View, the Physical View, and the Scenario (or Use Case) view.

![4+1 architecture model](/attachments/blogposts/2020/4plus1.jpg)
{: class="post-image post-image-70" }

- _Logical view_: supports functional requirements, this would contain domain objects
- _Process view_: addresses things like concurrency, system integrity, fault tolerance
- _Development view_: focuses on the organization of software in modules, libraries, subsystems (bounded contexts)
- _Physical view_: takes into account system qualities like availability, performance, scalability; it visualizes how the software runs on a network of nodes
- _Use case view_: small set of important scenarios that show all four views work together

### Visual Architecting Process

In 2019 I attended the Software Architecture workshop from Dana Bredemeyer and learned about the Visual Architecting Process by [Ruth Malan](https://ruthmalan.com/) & Dana Bredemeyer](http://bredemeyer.com/). They have lots of goodness to share about architecture and I really recommend this course.

One of the concepts I learned related to this post is four levels of architecture: Meta Architecture, Conceptual Architecture, Logical Architecture and Execution Architecture. A picture from the notes I took during the course:

![visual architecture process - levels](/attachments/blogposts/2020/visual-architecture-levels.jpg)
{: class="post-image post-image-70" }

- _Conceptual_: about components, collaborations and their rationale
- _Logical_: fully defined interfaces, rich description of responsibilities
- _Execution_: mapping components on physical resources, validate runtime quality requirements
- _Meta_: higher level guiding ideas, vision, philosophy & principles

The process is not linear but highly iterative: we take design decision at for instance the conceptual level, validate & record it, get interesting feedback from elaborating it on the Logical level, so we revisit the Conceptual level.
Along the way, we discover architecture principles and guidelines that we consider at the meta level.

### ...and more

There are more useful related approaches, like Simon Brown's [C4 Model for Visualising Architecture](https://c4model.com/).

## But we are cloud native!

We noticed that moving to a cloud based infrastructure tends to make the confusion worse. At various clients, we have seen developers enthusiastically embracing cloud services, making the infrastructure the leading view.
We understand that developers need some focus on cloud services, because cloud offerings tend to be quite complicated and have a steep learning curve.
Conflating the different views or leaving the conceptual view implicit will make it even more complicated.

Serverless does not mean you can stop thinking how to model your domain in software and how to manage dependencies.
It does take away some infrastructure concerns, but you still need to decide how to map your domain and logical components onto the infrastructure.

An interesting development in this area is linking financial models to (serverless) infrastructure. With cloud based infrastructure, we are moving away from mostly fixed cost infrastructure to more and more variable costs and pay-per-use.
The deployment view can provide interesting financial feedback on logical design decisions. Refactoring could have direct financial benefit.
Simon Wardley (of Wardley Mapping fame) talks about this in the [webinar he did together with Jamie Dobson on DevOps is the New Legacy](https://info.container-solutions.com/devops-is-the-new-legacy).

## Microservices will solve this!

No.

Microservices (or rather appropriately sized services) are a deployment concept, they are about what things you deploy together and what things need to be deployed separately.
The logical view of your software system is about capturing your domain and managing dependencies and consistency boundaries.
If you conflate the logical design with microservices, it becomes hard to make good decisions.

Alberto Brandolini elaborates on this in his recent post [About Bounded Contexts and Microservices](https://blog.avanscoperta.it/2020/06/11/about-bounded-contexts-and-microservices/).
He mentions the Bounded Context concept from Domain Driven Design, which is all about the logical architecture.

## But it is all connected!

It is. But that does not reduce the value of having the separate views. We still have to map the logical view onto the deployment view, which might result in some restrictions on the logical design decisions we take.
But with separate, clear views, this becomes easier.
This is a bit analogous to well-factored code that is way easier to optimize for performance than cluttered, entangled code.

## Conclusion

Having just one view on components mixes different concerns and makes it more difficult to make good decisions about e.g. dependencies.
This can lead to suboptimal design decisions, like splitting code at the wrong spots or a less optimal runtime environment, ultimately leading to production issues.

Having a logical view and a deployment view allows you to address different design and runtime trade-offs separately.
Different views enable you to have more focused, fruitful conversations about the different architecture and design decisions you make for the systems you develop.
