We are happy to announce that our strategic and tactical DDD teaching case is now publicly available.
Although the case description is just over a page, we managed to put domain complexity, ambiguity, and other challenges in there.

We have been running workshops on Domain Driven Design for over 10 years. We started out with some theory heavy material, but we switched to using event storming as a central practice for having participants learn DDD patterns and practices by doing. This worked out much better.
We use the case in combination with event storming exercises, to teach e.g. big picture event storming, finding subdomains, doing detailed system design. Try it for yourself! Spoiler: there is no one right solution, we have seen quite some variations in models.

Give it a try, and share your experiences with us (and the rest of the world)! We've had fun using it, we are curious how it works for you and what suggestions for improvement or extension you will come up with.

> **What is Event Storming?**  
> <a href="https://www.avanscoperta.it/it/eventstorming" target="_blank">Event storming</a> is a collaborative design practice invented by Alberto Brandolini. It is a group brainstorming process using paper, post-its and pens, to collaboratively build a shared model of a domain.

Want to try this out together? We can organize an introduction to Domain Driven Design, from a half-day intro to strategic design through a 2 day in-depth course to a learning path on implementing DDD - concept to cash.
