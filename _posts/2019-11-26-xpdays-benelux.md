Marc and Rob are running a
[[http://www.xpday.nl/thursday2019/#session_808][Hexagonal Architecture workshop]] this thursday at [XP Days Benelux](http://www.xpday.nl/), tickets for XP Days have sold out, but apparently there is a waitlist. So who knows, you still might be able to get a ticket.

We have been applying [Hexagonal Architecture](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/) to good effect, and helped others with it for a while now, so we thought we would take it on the road.

I asked a reviewer for another conference what they liked about the session. They mentioned that "working with paper, pens and post-its makes it available for a wider audience". This is always a challenge at conferences like xp days that try to please both a more and less technical audience. We hope you can go and see for yourself to what degree we achieve that goal.
