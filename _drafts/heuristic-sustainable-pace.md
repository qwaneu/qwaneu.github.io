Step away from the prompt
----

Coming up with good questions, 
Step away from the prompt, and come back while your subconcious does work. Especially with iterative tools like Claude Code, you can make good progress if you know what you are doing, and pressing 'Yes' on the next question and waiting for the result is addictive. Some people liken it to coffee, others to a slot machine (TODO links to reddit)

Link to sustainable pace. I started serious re-evaluation of computer assisted programming with LLMs with many questions. An umbrella question was: (how) do my current practices help or hinder working with [tool]. Sustainable pace didn't come up at first, Spicy autocomplete provided me with negative value - it got in the way of thinking. Aider + sonnet/gemini was sometimes a win, sometimes neutral, but fun. Claude Code is as addictive as when I started programming in secondary school. Easy to stay up late to see what the next thing is going to be.

I now see people with 5 terminals open, or exploring options in parallel. That is great. It means that you will need relatively more time to evaluate options (refer to Patrick Debois post - )

For a while I was impressed with people having multiple terminals open, then I went all in and had agents running in the background. Pinging me when it was done. The feedback bottleneck remains.

I still find that downtime, being away from work is important. Not just for my mental health, but also for the product. Spikes that are past the point that . past there sell by date. past the point of simplicity.

That code that didn't look quite right? let it be for a couple of days, write it again, TDD as if you meant it while waiting for your pair to show up (LINK to warm ups). Bask in the glow of focused, well tested code. And then merge it with the parts that came out of the coding agent that were good enough. Gradually raising the stakes (Jamie Dobson pattern)
