# introduction

We are seeing 'agile transformations' and other improvement initiatives that deliver some improvement, but not as much as initially hoped for.
Groups work somewhat iteratively, but delivering valuable product with software inside still takes too long and costs too much. All the while, technical debt continues to mount.

# So now what? Should we bet the house on technical excellence?

(ref to Jason). No, in this post we introduce a part of our perspective on software development. Software development is an interplay between three feedback loops. All three need love and care. 


# A systemic perspective: three interdependent feedback loops

This is a work in progress, informed by a Jason gorman demonstrating the influence of technical excellence on speed, as well as the agile fluency model (R TM C) that we have used to generate conversations with clients. We are using a slightly different terminology here, as we are exploring the space, we focus more on how the feedback loops function and interact with each other, less on specific capabilities.

So the three loops we consider here are, from inside to outside:

- Technical Excellence loop
- Working together + getting things done loop
- Product loop

# Leverage effects

iets over leverage effect van improvements in de tech excellence loop

# We need a whole systems approach (holistic approach?)

maar en dus moeten we vooral focussen op de tech excellence loop? nee, alle 3 hebben ze liefde & aandacht nodig (+ bespreken wat er gebeurt als je op 1 vd 3 focust en de andere onderbelicht of underfunded laat)

# how is this perspective helpful?

iets over hoe je het verder kan gebruiken

# closing notes

3 loops perspectief is niet allesomvattend maar biedt een nuttig perspectief (er zijn meer nuttige perspectieven)
