Marc and Rob are running a workshop on warmups at XP Days benelux. It's a workshop to share the ways we warm up for practice. I've been warming up as a participant by doing some code warmups. I had a chat with Rob earlier about the workshop. It is very much also about non-code warmups.

The surprising powers of warmups.

Writing and drawing have not been my strong points for a long time. The trick with both, for me, is finding a practice that works, for me. One such surpris was a series of introductury videos by the Concepts apps team. One was about ... doing warmups. @@TODO link / embed.

This warmup is surprisingly simple, and works with or without the app. It has you drawing lots of lines, circles and ellipsis. I tend to make a new layer in concepts and do a part of the warmup whenever I feel like it (sort of little and often). 


I find that whenever I do it, I am more likely to come up with something to draw. Sometimes I stop the warmup to draw something that pops up.

As Rob said:

  It is relatively easy to come up with all kinds of coding exercises, but it is not the exercises in itself that is interesting, and at the same time you focus completely on the exercise. (or discovering a useful exercise). A bit of a paradox, really. It is interesting to consider both what the exercise is, what to practice on _in_ the exercise and also how that is useful in your practice.

So now my circles are more circle shaped. I worry less about closing them perfectly. That means I'm more likely to draw something and have fun (a virtuous cycle). I also learnt to shade by hand, with lines. Something I hadn't thought about, since I would pick a pattern or brush for that, ever since Microsoft Paint in windows 1.03... It's fun, doesn't cost much time and makes a drawing look more natural.

As a consequence, my drawing sucks less. It is good enough to be accepted by colleagues into slide decks. One going as far as to say "I can't draw as well as you...". Well neither could I. Until I found a warmup that clicked.

##Â Benefits of warmups

Warmups help with creating, maintainig and improving fluency, in whatever you practice. You focus on a particular aspect ('just' drawing a line between two points). The first time a practice may create friction inyou. AFter that, you can focus on different aspects, or be in the flow and 'just do it' without thinking about it too much.
