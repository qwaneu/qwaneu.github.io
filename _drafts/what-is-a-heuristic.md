A heuristic is the most suitable definition of it that we can find at the time of posting, given the limits of our time and understanding.

We hope to have demonstrated a main use of heuristics by example. We engineer
this blog post, we want to have a working definition of Heuristic to refer to in
our [test driven development](/blog-by-tag#tag-test-driven-development), and
can't possibly comprehend everything that has been written about it, before the
time to publish about it has past.


Definition
------
> A heuristic is anything that provides a plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem but is in the final analysis unjustified, incapable of justification, and potentially fallible.

As defined in _Discussion of the Method: Conducting the Engineer's Approach to Problem Solving_. By Billy Vaughn Koen. 

Rebecca Wirfs-Brock explains well why this heuristics in general, and this book in particular are worth exploring. In [Growing Your Personal Heuristics Toolkit](http://wirfs-brock.com/blog/2019/03/20/growing-your-personal-design-heuristics/) she says:

> There are no guarantees. Heuristics can fail. The tenacity that defines an engineer is when she steps back, regroups, and finds a different heuristic to try next.

Heuristics in engineering
-----

> The engineering method is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources.

We lifted this from [a brief summary of "Discussion of the method"](http://johnljerz.com/superduper/tlxdownloadsiteMAIN/id174.html) by John L. Jerz that we found useful. 

Fun with heuristics

Gus Power reminded us of "Discussion of the method", when we found the unfinished sentence 'A heuristic is a ' in a draft for a previous post. We forgot what we wanted to say in that post, so asked Twitter:

Closing thought
-----

> You and I are participating in a magnificent experiment to see whether Nature's latest wrinkle, the human species armed with its new weapon, intelligence, has survival value.

From page 1 of Koens book. I've ordered it, but it seems to be taking a while to arrive from the US. In the meantime we'll continue to write up some of our [TDD heuristics](/blog-by-tag#tag-test-driven-development).

We hope to write more on heuristics once the book arrives, but for now, within the limits of our current understanding of heurics, this post must do.


Further reading

_Discussion of the Method: Conducting the Engineer's Approach to Problem Solving_. By Billy Vaughn Koen. This book is hard to find and expensive. We haven't put a link in. As soon as we've actually received a second hand copy that we ordered we will put in a link to the sellers' website, because they appeared to have more in stock.

[Growing Your Personal Heuristics
Toolkit](http://wirfs-brock.com/blog/2019/03/20/growing-your-personal-design-heuristics/) by Rebecca Wirfs-Brock.
The XKCD comic contained therein depicts a group decision process that looks
eerily familiar. We particularly like "Always give yourself a chance to
retreat". For us, the trick remains to keep reminding ourselves to use that chance to retreat.
