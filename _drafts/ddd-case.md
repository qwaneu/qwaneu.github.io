Over the 10 years we have been running workshops on Domain Driven Design. We started out with some theory heavy material, but we switched to using event storming as a central practice for having participants learn DDD patterns and practices by doing. This worked out much better.

We have created a case that we use for teaching both strategic and tactical domain driven design. Although the case description is just over a page, we managed to put domain complexity, ambiguity, and other challenges in there.

We are happy to announce that we are making this case publicly available, under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). This means you can use the case freely, also for commercial purposes, as long as you give appropriate credit. If you make derivative work (e.g. an improved or extended version), it should be distributed under the same license.

You can [download the EdiTrain case here (PDF)]().

We use the case in combination with event storming exercises, to teach e.g. big picture event storming, finding subdomains, doing detailed system design. Try it for yourself! Spoiler: there is no one right solution, we have seen quite some variations in models.

Give it a try, and share your experiences with us (and the rest of the world)! We've had fun using it, we are curious how it works for you and what suggestions for improvement or extension you will come up with.

Want to try this out together? We can organize an introduction to Domain Driven Design, from a half-day intro to strategic design to a 2 day in-depth course or workshops on implementing DDD.
