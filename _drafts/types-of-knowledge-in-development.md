Software delivery is "knowledge work". Knowledge is a broad concept, there is a whole field of knowledge management, there's a body of knowledge about learning and training.

In this post we want to zoom in on some specific forms of knowledge that play a role in software development. Knowing these types of knowledge enables you to make effective use of them but also to recognize the effects. It can help you to recognize when you are working "against the system" or where it's beneficial to direct your efforts.

As 'knowledge' is a broad concept with different possible meanings, we will use it here in a more restricted scope

Let's use [Wikipedia's page on knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) as a starting point:
> "Knowledge is an awareness of facts, a familiarity with individuals and situations, or a practical skill. (...) It often involves the possession of information learned through experience and can be understood as a cognitive success or an epistemic contact with reality, like making a discovery. (...)
> Knowledge is often understood as a state of an individual person, but it can also refer to a characteristic of a group of people as group knowledge, social knowledge, or collective knowledge. Some social sciences understand knowledge as a broad social phenomenon that is similar to culture." (as of 24 October 2025)

We take a pragmatic perspective on knowledge: knowledge informs/steers behaviour; in software development, developers use knowledge to make decisions about architecture, design, code structure, tests, etc.

Software development from a socio-technical perspective: it's not just the software that we are developing and maintaining, but also the teams and organisation structures around it, with their know-how (knowledge).

That sounds great but it is still quite broad and vague. Let's make it more concrete and practical.

Combining ideas from knowledge management, biology and systemic thinking, we distinguish these four types of knowledge that play an important role in software development:

1. Explicit knowledge - knowledge that we can express and codify
2. Tacit knowledge - implicit, embodied, personal know-how
3. Systemic knowledge - knowledge embedded in the human systems we are part of, "culture"
4. Stigmergic knowledge - knowledge that is part of an environment

## Explicit knowledge - what we can express and codify 

Explicit knowledge has been codified, in documents, procedures, manuals, instructions, tutorials, etc. It resides explicitly in artifacts. Explicit knowledge is externalized (not confined in someone's head) and transferable.

Note: we're using 'codify' here in the sense of expressing something explicitly in some (natural, formal, or semi-formal) language. This can include source code, e.g. representing domain concepts and domain language explicitly in classes and names in the code. There is however more to code, as we will show below.

### Tacit - embodied knowledge

Tacit knowledge is know-how, skills, experience, intuition possessed by people, which are not codified and are hard to express or codify. Often this is embodied knowledge, e.g. riding a bicycle, playing a music instrument. Because tacit knowledge is not/hardly codifiable, it needs a different approach for transferring it. Transferring these kind of skills requires social and experiential learning. E.g. apprenticeships, learning by doing guided by an expert.

Because we cannot codify tacit knowledge, we cannot document everything that a developer needs to know. To share tacit knowledge, we need forms of social and experiential learning within the team. For example: if a team works with pull requests, a pull request review using written text is an unsuitable form to convey know-how from a more senior developer to a less skilled developer. For effective knowledge transfer, they need to sit and work together.

Earlier on, the idea was that tacit knowledge could be transformed into explicit knowledge through socialization and externalization, but more recent insights are that tacit knowledge is mostly uncodifiable and literally embodied - part of a person's body.

## Systemic knowledge

Taking a systemic perspective, a team forms a system, and is part of a larger system (department, business unit, organization, society). Team members themselves are also part of multiple systems, at work, at home, in their families.

These human systems are uniquely determined by their histories - by everything that has happened. So systems have a history and a memory, and in that way they have knowledge that influences their members' behaviour. This knowledge usually survives individual members, who might come and go. 

People often refer to this as "culture" (team culture, organisation culture), but we don't find the term "culture" very helpful. What we call culture is actually an emergent property, formed by all interactions and events over time [het is een resultante?]. This means that you cannot "change culture", you can only influence the events and interactions that will take place, and you'll have to deal with the history that's already there.

What does this mean for a software team?
