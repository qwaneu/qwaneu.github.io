Our training courses are intensive and hands-on. We offer both open enrolment courses and customized in-company courses, on-site and remote. We work with small groups up to 14 participants to ensure an optimal learning experience.

We deliver our courses in English, Dutch, German or French (together with our German and French partners).
Programming exercises are available in: Java, C#, C++, Scala, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

If you have a need that is not covered by an existing course, [we are happy to make new ones for you](/contact). Our best courses got started by specific requests from our customers!
