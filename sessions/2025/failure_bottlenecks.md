title: "Optimizing for value: fight failure demand with bottlenecks" 
layout: other-accessible
---

Format: 45 minute talk

Abstract:

In software development, addressing bottlenecks - places in software that are perceived to perform poorly - often involves scaling hardware or optimizing services to handle increased load. However, a deeper look reveals that many performance issues stem from redundant or value-less requests upstream. This talk explores how combining the Theory of Constraints with the concept of Failure Demand can help us see and improve. We can enhance system efficiency, improve user satisfaction, and drive genuine business value, while having fun doing it.
