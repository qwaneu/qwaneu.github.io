So we are trying
[a leaner way of creating conference
programs](http://www.qwan.eu/en/blog/shorter-conference-session-cycle) .
How is it going so far with /dev/summer, the free one day event for
developers? We took just two weeks to advertise the program
of [/dev/summer](http://devcycles.net/summer/). Not too bad. We're not
facing a deluge of sessions on one hand, on the other hand, we got some
nice sessions coming in, so after tomorrow night we probably can put
together a program without turning many sessions away. On the one hand
it's great if you can be selective, on the other hand, it feels wasteful
to have people propose and review sessions and then only run half or
less of them. On the other, other hand, this also enables us to give
feedback fast to the presenters. 

As a presenter, I hate it when my session proposals end up in a void,
and a result only emerges after weeks, or even months. It's even worse
with conferences that don't provide feedback beyond an accept or reject.
My policy is, if it's an accept, I'll go, and talk to the organisers
when I'm there. If it's a reject without feedback, I'll choose another
event to attend, and don't do it again next year. 

We started out without a public call, which is a first for me. The first
round of invitations showed me that being on the edge of the summer
holiday is not an advantage, to say the least. For participants it seems
to matter less, the event is already generating a healthy interest. 

I do have the feeling that I haven't spend this much effort promoting
a call for sessions. But that may just be that memories of effort put in
conferences past fades fast, and everything that happens around the
program is now compressed in just a few weeks.

The call for sessions is open until tomorrow night, if you [hand
something in](http://devcycles.net/summer) you have a good chance of
getting it in - we have a great and somewhat flexible space that makes
this easy.
