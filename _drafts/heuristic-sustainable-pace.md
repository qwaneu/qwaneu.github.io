Step away from the prompt
----

Coming up with good questions, 
Step away from the prompt, and come back while your subconscious does work. Especially with iterative tools like Claude Code, you can make good progress if you know what you are doing, and pressing 'Yes' on the next question and waiting for the result is addictive. 

The question is, addictive like what? Coffee? A slot machine? Can you stop whenever you want to?

Link to sustainable pace. I started serious re-evaluation of computer assisted programming with LLMs with many questions. An overarching question was: (how) do my current practices help or hinder working with [tool]. Sustainable pace didn't come up at first. 

(this might go into a separate post about where I am with these tools. The link to sustainable pace is situational awareness, and if these tools help / hinder or are neutral).
The first tools I saw mid 2024 were uninspiring. Spicy auto-complete (github co-pilot, jetbrains AI assistant) provided me with negative value - blurbs of expanding text got in the way of thinking even more than regular auto-complete. I value wishful thinking much over seeing what is already there. It is easy enough to get stuck inside a box, and auto-complete reinforces that. (Spicy auto-complete, revisited)

Later in 2024 Aider TODO link with sonnet or gemini as models was sometimes a win, sometimes neutral, but fun. Claude Code is as addictive as when I started programming in secondary school. Easy to stay up late to see what the next thing is going to be.

Then, this spring, I  saw people with 5 terminals open, or exploring options in parallel. That is great (cue irony). It means that you will need more time to evaluate the results. (see moldable developent)

For a while I was impressed with people having multiple terminals open, then in August I went all in and had agents running in the background. Pinging me when it was done. This was even more addictive. What has claude code cooked up for me overnight? I don't know, the feedback bottleneck remained.

Now I have better, incremental and iterative tooling (link to a view to a vibe), but still, having an opinion on generated code takes time. 

I still find that downtime, being away from work is important. Not just for my mental health, but also for the product. Spikes that are past the past the point of simplicity (TODO, express better) can be better contemplated away from the keyboard.

That code that didn't look quite right? let it be for a couple of days, write it again, TDD as if you meant it while waiting for your pair to show up (LINK to warm ups). Bask in the glow of focused, well tested code. And then merge it with the parts that came out of the coding agent that were good enough. Gradually raising the stakes (Jamie Dobson pattern and/or Spike and Stabilise)
