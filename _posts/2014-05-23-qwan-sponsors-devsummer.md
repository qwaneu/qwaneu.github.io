We've always been active in the UK, even more so now Willem has moved to
the UK (although he is doing work on the continent as well).

So we've decided to sponsor a new one day conference for developers in
Cambridge, on July 12. It's called /dev/summer . It's held on a
Saturday, so that developers who might otherwise not attend a conference
can attend. As (recovering) conference addicts ourselves it is hard to
imagine, but if some people work in projects with lots of pressure or in
companies that don't really understand the value of learning.

Anyway, it's looking like it's going to be a fun event. We already have
a few sessions lined up. If you're interested in running a talk or
hands-on tutorial, the [call for sessions](http://devcycles.net/summer/) is open.

We hope to see you there, even if it is just to add some more
refactoring cards to your collection ;)
