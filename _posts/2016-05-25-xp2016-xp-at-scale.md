Elizabeth Hendrickson keynoting on eXtreme programming at scale. Elizabeth works as VP R&D for
Cloud foundry development at Pivotal.

Some numbers: 59 teams, 251 engineers 7 locations and a bunch of timezones.

eXtreme Programming is supported by the management team, because one of the founders was an early adopter, he reviewed the first edition of eXtreme Programming explained before it came out.

## Underlying principles

Breakfast and lunch together (I wonder how that works for people with kids, I like having some breakfast at home).

## Practices

mostly the 12 original xp practices. works great for a single team. What about more teams.
