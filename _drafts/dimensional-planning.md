## problems that are tackled by DP

The customer wants it all and wants the best; you try to convince them that they will not need all the bells and whistles but the customer won't buy that. And you know only when the customer gets their hands on the software, they will understand what they really need.

A functionality/feature that "just does the job" is harder to sell


## origins of DP

Koen Van Exem; using it to sell fixed scope, fixed budget, fixed time projects 

'scope' is not a long fixed list of functionalities; such a list is usually a proxy for the actual value a customer is seeking, but the functionalities is his/her frame of thinking, much easier to articulate; that's not a customer flaw per se, as developers it is our job to help find the real underlying value

## the metaphor, by example


Dirt road - cobblestone road - highway


## How does it relate to/mix with other techniques?

Link to User Story Mapping (http://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/) - link to ‘walking skeleton’ (note: slightly different from dirt road); DP is great way to define/slice releases in USM; helps in general as a decision support method for slicing, planning and finding minimal sets of work that deliver optimal expected value

## Some of our experiences

a metaphor works well, especially when communicating with business (non-tech people)

you can adapt the metaphor to your own context a bit ("adding your own egg"), e.g. paper cup, coffee mug, silver chalice
