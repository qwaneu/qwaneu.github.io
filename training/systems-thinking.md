In our work, we have noticed that changing your software development
method changes your organisation. We have run into questions like:

* Why can’t the customer keep up with the development team and what can be done about it?
* Why is it so hard to introduce agile in some organizations?
* What are common failure modes of agile transitions and what can we do to work around these?
* How can we get a team to start unit testing (or any other good technical practice)? Is lack of unit testing really the biggest problem?
* What are the underlying dynamics of adding people to a project and how can we use these to increase project velocity?


While several development methodologies describe a recipe for practices
that worked in a specific context, the exact same recipe is not
guaranteed to work in all circumstances.

Along our journey we have discovered and mastered a number of useful
                thinking and doing tools that help us become better reflective
                practitioners and find answers to the above questions, tools that we
                have found useful in making sense of what’s happening in our
organizations.

### Benefits

This course helps you to effect substantial change in small,
controllable steps, and prevent local (sub)optimization. Understanding
why your process works the way it works helps you see the extent to
which a practice is effective in its context. It also helps your
organization grow its own way of developing software.

After participating in this course you will:

* view software organizations from a different, systemic perspective
* find root causes for all kinds of persistent, messy team problems
* understand why different software organization work and can work and
why they sometimes stop working effectively
* adapt your change initiatives to the specific organizational context
* understand how change happens in individuals and organizations, and
what this means for steering a change process

### Practical information

* Duration: 1 day
* No laptops required
* This training is available as open enrollment and in-house.
