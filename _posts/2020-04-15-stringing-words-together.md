Work has, once again for me, become more personal. I'm getting back into
writing. This is a quick, rambling, update, so you can at least get some idea of what we are up to
at the moment.

The title of this post is inspired by a colleague who wrote on Twitter he had
difficulty stringing sentences together, and was giving himself permission to
take it back a few notches.

Marc and Rob are working with an existing client, turning everything they did
on-site into distributed activities (e.g. running a course program, workshops,
mentoring). This seems to be working out well.

QWAN was already distributed, and now work even more asynchnonously.

I'm working half-time, my partner works the other half, scheduling my time
around her meetings. After my previous large project ended, I decided to spend
more time with our three year old, before he goes to school in September. I'm
now spending even more time with him. He misses nursery, like his big sister
misses school, but he also enjoys spending time with us.

Before we went into self-isolation a month ago, I thought about what I wanted,
and what I could do. I'm still thinking about that, while doing what I came up
with. I chose to pause product development, and continue a few things that are
not urgent. Choosing things that are not urgent makes it easier to be fully
present for the kids. I've been chipping away at making the QWAN site more
accessible, and seeing if I can finish the property-based testing workbook. We
also made space to volunteer locally, through a charity.

These are all moves that will give us no regrets, and carry verry little risk.
As [Jamie Dobson and Pini Reznik write in a Pattern language for Strategy](https://www.container-solutions.com/a-pattern-language-for-strategy-chapter-ii):

Both writing and working on the QWAN site can be done in small steps, which is
handy given the blocks available are small, and interruptible, and
interruptible. My product development work seems to need larger chunks of time,
despite my best efforts to make it not so. That makes it is a less good fit at
the moment. Work is optional, because I've made it so that, even though it is a
web service, it keeps humming along without work on my part.

It helped that I started clearing the decks late 2019, so this is 'simply' more
of the same. Perversely, I wanted to travel less, but did miss seeing my
colleagues. I've attended two of Johannes Link's [Property-Driven Development
sessions](https://johanneslink.net/online/), and 'saw' a few people I haven't seen in years.

I've been on twitter a lot more than usual. It helps to make sense of what is
going on, and seeing other parents write about how they do things helps. I've
taken a break over the extended easter weekend. It was hard at first, but it
helped being more present with my family, as well as focus on something.

I've dived into 'The Practice of Programming', by Kernighan & Pike. Jez Higgins
(link) recommended this to me. It is from the same year as Becks' Extreme
Programming explained. Tonight we're gonna program like it's 1999! The book covers
some similar territory, how to produce clear code, and at the same time is very
different. Reading from paper and doing the exercises is nice. This is my
knitting.

The accessibility work on the QWAN site appears to be progressing nicely.
Appears, because I still need to user test it, which usually turns up more
challenges. Humans are complicated, rules and guidelines (Firefox accessibility
inspector does help) only get you so far. Johannes Link's workshops and,
surprisingly, The practice of Programming are giving me some inspiration to
improve the exercises in the property based testing workbook.

I'm also thinking about what kind of client work would be most useful, and how I
can and would like to fit it into this new reality.
