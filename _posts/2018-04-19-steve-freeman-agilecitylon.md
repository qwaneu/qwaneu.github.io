If you work in IT long enough, all your assumptions are wrong (quote from ...). Also if you work in IT long enough, old ideas come back into fashion,

# Homeopathic OO

"OO is over, because we are all doing functional". Look up google trends. Scrum going up, agile, xp and everything else going down. Except jenkins and selenium. Agile development for most organisations means scrum, what that means for those organisations is anyone's guess.

Eric Hoffer: "Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business and turns into a racket" - from The True Believer

# Some things have improved

More teams deliver (even if brittle and hopelessly compromised). Wider spread of iterative development.

A younger generation have never known anything but hosted CI servers.

Some XP teams get bored because everything just works, and they just ship features.

# Refactoring

"It was a huge relief when the book came out, because it gave credibility to good practice". "I first experienced pairing at XEROX research as an intern, where it was used to introduce people to systems they only had. I hated it, because I could not get into the zone. I just wanted to be left alone".

"I used to go onto yahoo to check the 30 odd new websites that had gone online" (I would look on the internet map of the netherlands for the same).

There is nothing quite so internally consistent and live as a smalltalk environment. Go and have a poke around with a free one like Pharo.
