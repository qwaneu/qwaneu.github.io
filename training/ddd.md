Our DDD courses are intensive and hands-on. We offer customized in-company courses, on-site and remote. We work with small groups up to 14 participants to ensure an optimal learning experience.

We deliver our courses in English or Dutch. We have companies in the UK and the Netherlands, and mostly serve the EU and the UK markets, but are open for other locations.

Our interest in aligning stakeholders and developers through shared language and metaphor, and a common way to work together on successful deisgns and outcomes predates the DDD books. We apply DDD patterns where applicable in our work as product designers, developers and architects, and guide participants through the contexts and problems for which they are suited. After a workshop, participants usually have inspiration to tastefully apply at least some of the patterns and practices covered in the course.

We are working to describe more of the Domain Driven Design workshops that we have made. The first two are described in [DDD introduction](/training/ddd-introduction), for a wide audience, often with a mix of software roles and stakeholders, and [Implementing DDD](/training/implementing-ddd"). The next one, currently known as "Advanced Topics" covers implementation patterns with more nuanced trade-offs, like Event Sourcing. [we are happy to make new ones for you](/contact)

We have included [Hexagonal Architecture](/training/hexagonal-architecture) in this overview, as it is a pattern, that often goes well together with other DDD patterns. It keeps our hard won domain concepts separate from, also needed, plumbing in our applications and services.

        <p>Domain-driven design is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the architecture and implementation to an evolving model of the problem domain. It enables an agile approach to complex software development by putting the domain model central.

        <p>Domain-driven design is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the architecture and implementation to an evolving model of the problem domain. Working from your domain facilitates higher quality software products that will be better maintainable.

        <p>Our software should be about the business weâ€™re in, about the problem domain we are working in. It should speak domain language, not technicalities. Hexagonal Architecture puts the domain logic front and centre.</p>
