"words mean things" - Geert Bossuyt
- improve -> grow
- assessment -> diagnostic
- help -> ?
- problem/solution -> forces/tension, resolve/reinforce/dampen
- causal -> dispositional

if we call our initiatives "projects" it will influence our thinking, seeing it as a plannable thing. Ok for Complicated, misfit with Complex

words and names steer/influence our thinking; 
often at subconscious level


nominal fallacy
