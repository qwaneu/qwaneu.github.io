title:  More information on cynefin and complexity
author: Marc

This week Willem and I presented at the [Modern Management Methods
NL conference](http://lknl.leankanban.com/) (formerly known as Lean Kanban NL). We did a presentation
about applying frameworks like Cynefin to make sense of what's
happening, in your team, your project, your organisation...

You can [download our slides
(PDF)](/attachments/systemicthinking_lknl13.pdf).

I tweeted a link to a number of links with more information about
complexity and cynefin, but [@WimHeemskerk](https://twitter.com/WimHeemskerk) kindly pointed out that some
of them were broken. So here's an updated reading list with some
additions:
