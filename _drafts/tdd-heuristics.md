## TDD
- Think about design in the test
- Wishful thinking
- start with assert/expectation
- 0, 1, N
- Act stupid in implementation
- Faking & Cheating
- Triangulation

## Unit testing
- Test name describes the action and the expected result
- One (conceptual) assert per test
- Test cases follow common setup
- Take as much care for test code as you do for production code
- Tests are independent - always start from a clean slate
- Given-When-Then or Arrange-Act-Assert
- No more than one failing test at a time
- Fix one failing test at a time
- What is a unit test? (Feathers)
- Rules for simple design 4+1
- Mirroring
- Focus on relevant data
