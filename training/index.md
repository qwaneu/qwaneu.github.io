[Our training courses](#training-courses) are intensive, hands-on. We work with small groups (up to 14 participants) to ensure an optimal learning experience.

We deliver our courses and workshop in English or Dutch. Together with our German and French partners, we can also deliver in German or French.

For the exercises in our hands on development skills courses, we can use Java, C#, Scala, Ruby, Python, Javascript, or TypeScript.

We offer both Open Enrollment courses and customized in-company courses. If you have a need that is not covered by an existing course, we are happy 
to make new ones for you. Our best courses got started by specific 
requests from our customers!
