Us three, having fallen into a conversation with code.

Me: Hey, we are Mob Programming...
Rob: no we are not
Me: hmm. you're right. Marc has had the keyboard for thirty minutes
Rob: you can have it
Me: no, then I can't hold my coffee
Rob: "Marc, type "less-than p r e"
Me: that CSS is rubbish
Me:  This is more like Statler and Waldorf programming. I quite like it.
Rob & Marc: Blogpost!
Rob: graphics should be easy to find
