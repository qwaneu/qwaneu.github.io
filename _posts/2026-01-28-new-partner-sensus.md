"You deserve to understand your software!" This is what came out as tag line for Sensus' [Architecture Review service](https://domeinmodel.nl/architecture-review/). After Stephan Eggermont's [The state of LLM Agentic Flows](https://domeinmodel.nl/the-state-of-llm-agentic-flows/) went viral on LinkedIn, it was high time to describe the kind of thing they do for clients in more detail. 

Especially now that Sensus' is a QWAN partner. Marc suggested to invite Sensus, as a partner, after Stephan Eggermont has done a lot of work with me on [QWAN Tracker](https://qtracker.apps.sustainabledelivery.com/) and more visual collaboration tools. I've learnt a lot about moldable development through Stephan, and his view on architecture, code and the role AI augmentation in this is very complimentary to ours.

Having active visuals like this, where you can zoom in, zoom out, click through to see details is very valuable to determine next steps for a software system. Sensus makes these for code, as well as for data. To us they may be interchangeable, to stakeholders a picture tells more than a thousand data points.
