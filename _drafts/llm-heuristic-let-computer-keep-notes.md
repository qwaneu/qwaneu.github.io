**TODO*** link 'some tools** to ollama


Keep a <strikethrough>notebook</strikethrough> PEN pal
----

**TODO** check if the strikethrough works

Keep ing a *Prompt Engineering Notebook* - PEN can help. A PEN pal helps you think out loud, and keep track of your experiments. I use some command line tools that don't have an editor, writing longer prompts in an editor or word processor can help you clarify your thoughts before the model goes mental with it.

Literal pen pals can also help. There are some private slack channels in which I think out loud, documenting my adventures, getting questions and feedback. I occasionally write summaries of long threads. This helps me clarify my thoughts, and the feedback and seeing others' approaches is valuable. 



Next iteration is :

Let the computer be your notebook {#reflect-on-questions}

The web chats of ChatGPT, google Gemini, and many open source models keep a list of chats on the left hand side (I am playing with Mollama on Ipad at the moment - screenshot), you can add chats to the left, and read back through your chats.

Locally, I use he `llm` tool logs all of your questions, answers and metadata (e.g. how many tokens were used, which model was involved, time of request) and makes them searchable. 

This fits well in my natural habitat for writing and experimenting. I often work with a terminal, and use a text editor instead of a word processor to write. Tools like `llm** integrate well with that way of working. 

**TODO** provide link to llm tools

Seeing back some chats I had last year is educational. Also, I didn't just imagine it, I have a reference.
