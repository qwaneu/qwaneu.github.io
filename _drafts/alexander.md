Last week, [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) passed away at the age of 85. Alexander was an architect with profound new ideas on habitable architecture. His architecture ideas have had an even more profound influence on software development.
Alexander was a big influence for the patterns movement in software in the 90s, and indirectly influenced the rise of agile software development, which mostly grew out of the patterns movement.

Alexander's ideas and work has also been a great source of inspiration and influence for me for the last 25 years.

In the late 90s, I was studying design patterns together with Willem at university in the 2nd half of the 90s. Design patterns were at that time not part of the regular curriculum, but it was an elective course. These were fascinating ideas, although we were initially for some time in how to apply these patterns effectively.

We started looking at where these ideas came from, leading to Christopher Alexander as the source for the design pattern concept. I wanted to learn more! In the university library I found the Timeless Way of Building and Notes on the Synthesis of Form. 

Reading the Timeless Way of Building was a profound experience, life-changing in a way. This was a wonderful book to read, well written, with beautiful, timeless black-and-white photos. The philosophy Alexander laid down in that book touched me although at that time it was hard to fully grasp it. But I was hooked! In this book, Alexander introduced the idea of "quality without a name" - the quality that we feel, that we know that is there in a place, but we cannot put this quality in words, because words like 'beautiful' do not fully capture it.

In the years that followed, I got my own copies of The Timeless Way, A Pattern Language and Notes on the Synthesis of Form. I read Richard P. Gabriel's ["Patterns of Software - Tales from the Software Community"](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Software-Tales-Community/dp/0195121236) book (freely available [from Gabriel's site](https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf))

I also got my hands on the beautiful [A Foreshadowing of 21st Century Art](http://www.patternlanguage.com/bookstore/foreshadowing-of-21st-century-art.html) book (aka the Turkish rugs book) which unfortunately is hard to get hold of nowadays.

Another seminal book that builds upon Alexander's work is [Stewart Brand](https://twitter.com/stewartbrand)'s [How Buildings Learn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn), a beautiful book, again a joy to read, about how buildings evolve over time. Most change takes place _after_ a building is initially built, and there are several shearing layers of change within a building, each moving at its own pace.

These books and their ideas have had a significant influence on how I developed myself and how I developed my view and approach on software development.

When I started my own company in the mid-2000s, I was looking for a name that was a good match with my approach and the way I look at software development and growing development organizations. After some discussions with my partner, and having the initial name being rejected by the chamber of commerce, I turned to the Timeless Way for inspiration (re-reading it brings joy every time). I picked 'Piecemeal Growth' as the name for my company. 

Alexander's idea of Piecemeal Growth referred to the continuous process by which buildings, neighborhoods, cities develop. Habitable places don't come from some grand design, but rather from a continuous process of building and 'repairing' any misfits that come to the surface. Software development is very similar, both in the products we develop and in the teams and their processes. Both evolve through a process of piecemeal growth.

A few years later, Willem, Rob and I decided to join forces and start working under a common label. Again we turned to our shared source of inspiration - Christopher Alexander, and we took up the name 'QWAN - Quality Without a Name', which for us is the thing we are looking for within our domain - software development. We work with others towards achieving that quality in our work, in our products.

Last week, I finally got round to start reading Alexander's latest seminal work, The Nature of Order. This is another profound work, laying down a new view on how we look at order and life. The 4 volumes (!) had been standing on my bookshelf for quite some time. I'd tried reading it before, but apparently I wasn't ready for it yet. Until last Tuesday a colleague asked me: tomorrow is your day off, what would you really like to do? (instead of just picking up chores and being busy). I looked at my boofshelf and I felt it was time to immerse myself in the Nature of Order. 

Sadly, the day after, Alexander passed away. We appreciate his contributions to our field, and the influence he had on me, on the three of us. We will keep applying and teaching his ideas, and keep his name alive.
