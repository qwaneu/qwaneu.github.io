Management

- People should (be willing to, and ask for help if they struggle to) manage themselves
- Only people who can manage themselves should manage others (jerry weinberg /
  leanpub congruent change)
- Psychological safety and continuous coaching are necessary for people to
  evolve into adding managing others to managing themselves
