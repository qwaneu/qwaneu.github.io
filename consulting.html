<h3>How we work</h3>

<p>Invite us for a conversation to discuss your situation and what would be the best fitting approach.

<p>Alternatively, you can hire us to do a short project or process audit (1 day), where we investigate a project or process based on a question you have through interviews, observation and inspection of e.g. documents and code. We report our findings back to you.

<p>Based on our findings we propose how we can proceed, e.g. hands on mentoring, one on one coaching, or additional training.

<p>Our consulting engagements typically last from a few weeks to several months. We practice what we preach: to us agile software development is about continuously adding value and learning how to do better. Therefore we frequently inspect and adapt our approach and the value it adds to your organisation. You have the opportunity to conclude or extend the engagement at any time.

<p>Call us to discuss what we could do for you.

<h3>Agile Coaching</h3>

<p>We help teams getting started with agile or taking their next step. We find that usually getting started does not take that much effort. It all depends on the willingness and enthousiasm of the teams.

<p>We can coach management in their agile thinking, teams in concrete agile practices and we can pair-program with your developers to teach them Test Driven Development or help them solve their TDD issues like: working with legacy code.

<h3>Architecture audits</h3>

<p>We are hands-on agile software practitioners with thens of years of experience in analysis design and implementation of software in environments ranging from J2EE, through Smalltalk to embedded software. Our experience enables us to carry out audits on architecture and code quality.

<h3>Process audit and reviews</h3>

<p>Would you like to gain insight in your way of working? Would you like to do a health check of your development process? Are you looking for the next step of agile development but you are not sure which direction to go?

<p>In a limited amount of time (a few days), we can give you insight in and feedback about your development process, and recommendations for the next steps to take. We do this by interviewing and observing your teams, e.g. stand up meetings, retrospectives, planning meetings.
