We have been doing a number of Agile Fluency diagnostic workshops with several teams this year. In this workshop, which is a kind of team retrospective, we discover together with a software team how fluent they are in the different fluency zones. The 3 most interesting zone in the Agile Fluency model are:
- Focusing - ...
- Delivering - ...
- Optimizing - ...

What we sometimes see teams that are not doing that many retrospectives. Everything seems to be going well enough, they say, and there is not so much to discuss in their retrospectives, or the retrospectives become a bit of a drag. Our observation is that the team _are_ doing quite ok, but we see sufficient room for improving 'productivity'. 

## Productivity

Looking at Agile Fluency zone benefits, they mention increased ROI (return on investment), which tends to come from making better product and priority decisions so that you deliver more value sooner. They also mention increased productivity/efficiency. Now productivity is a dangerous, overloaded term within software development (anyone remember counting lines of code as a measure of productivity?).

Let's define productivity loosely as the share of a team's time that they spend on doing valuable stuff. Valuable stuff is not only working on features and changes that are valuable to users and customers, but also time spent on learning, on doing structural fixes in the CI/CD pipeline, etc. So it is about being valuable in the short term and in the long term. 

Fixing bugs, context switching because of late feedback, monitoring builds and restarting because of flaky tests are all activities that do not add value and which keep productivity down.

So what can a team do to improve productivity? Regular reflection is key here: reflect on your way of working, trying to find better ways of organizing your work and creating more flow.

Reducing misunderstandings and waiting because of hand-offs of work by close collaboration and communication also helps to save time and be more productive.

Teams that get fluent in the Delivering zone work on their technical excellence. This increases productivity by having low defect rates, little rework. Delivering quality work and having low defect rates also changes the dynamics in the team and make the context more joyful to work in. This affects retention positively and helps productivity in the long term.

## A little pressure

We think teams benefit from a little pressure, and some sense of urgency, to trigger a quest for higher productivity.

We noticed that 'pressure' often has a negative connotation. In more stressful times or when the stakes are high, some managers put pressure on development teams to deliver more stuff faster, urging them to 'work harder'. Team members feel the pressure and think the only option is to work overtime (often unpaid) to deliver to the high demands.

## Working harder

Overtime acts as a buffer that absorbs any high demands. It is magic extra time,
by which the 60 hour job suddenly fits into 40 hours. This is not being
productive. On the contrary, by absorbing the high demand, there is no urge to
stop, reflect, and find smarter ways of working. Neither is there an urge to
call into question whether the demanded features are really necessary to achieve
value and find a simpler way to your goals. Worse, it reinforces the idea that
the team can actually do 60 hour jobs in 40 hours.

And it is even worse: research has shown that overtime quickly becomes counterproductive. Within weeks of working overtime, you actually become less productive than if you would not have worked overtime at all.
[bron??](https://lifehacker.com/working-over-40-hours-a-week-makes-you-less-productive-1725646811). And it quickly burns out people. In summary, overtime is inhumane and achieves the opposite of what people intend: lower instead of higher productivity.

We have another issue with saying people should "work harder", namely the
assumption that they are currently not doing their best. It is a reasonable
assumption that everyone is doing their best given what they know, their
skills,the resources available to them and the situation at hand (cf. the [prime
directive for
retrospectives](http://www.retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive)).

Yes occasionally we have to deal with a low performing contributor, but this is
management's job to act on this. Most of the time getting better outcomes and
being more productive is a systemic issue - it follows from the system of work,
and how the team works as a system in relation to its environment.

So overtime and shouting "work harder!" is not going to work. This is not the way to a more productive team. Using pressure in this way will have the opposite effect of what management tries to achieve. 

## Enabling constraints

There is a different way to use a moderate amount of pressure. Taking a complex systems perspective, we can look at enabling constraints [@@+ definitie]. We can use constraints with a team to create a context for them where they feel the urge to continuously reflect, look for improvements, innovate, but also to optimize for flow of work, speed & quality of decisions, questioning what to build, finding Dirt Roads.

Clear objectives and constraints on time and effort - pick a date, work with the team as it is, mind the 32 / 40 weekly hours but also breaks, etc. that people need. 

Then challenge the team to find their way of achieving the goal.

This is what we mean with 'pressure' - just enough pressure for a team to have a sense of urgency, to trigger a bit of creativity but also invite push back - "help me reach this goal; help me find a simpler way; if it is impossible, say so, and then find something that is ambitious but achievable together".

## Keep on growing 

What we see in practice is that teams get more fluent in particular in Focusing and Delivering capabilities, because of demands of their organization, their context, the market the organization is operating in. After some time the teams plateau and what they do is good enough. Urge to grow further fades a bit.
