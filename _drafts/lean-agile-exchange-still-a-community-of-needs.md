Lean Agile Exchange - still a community of needs conference

I was wondering if Lean Agile Exchange @@link @@date would be as much a Community of Needs
conference as e.g. Lean Agile Scotland or Agile Cambridge was.

Steve Freeman recently recommended Chris Matts' presentation at and on Lean
Agile Scotland from four years ago about community of needs versus community of
solutions conferences.

as Chris says: "Community of solutions conference often don't address the needs at all. Community of
solutions keynotes are highly polished, delivered by someone who has deliverd
the same presentation ten times a year for twenty years."

My quick summary animation looks like this:

Community of needs sessions can be recognized by questions, or uncomfortable
truths that don't necessarily sell anything. The keynotes at Lean Agile Exchange
were a good example of that. And hand-drawn slides, made in the spur of the moment.

The conference slack channel also was lively, with people asking questions like
"why do the programmers around here believe functional programs don't need
tests", and "Has anyone tried to authoritatively write down the names for things
used in the organisation?"

From the regular sessions the one by Gwen Diagram's on Cynicism stood out, Gwen's
talk was so full of energy, I managed to stay awake for it after a long day
of on-line conference. An enormous amount of slides with photos and lively story
telling. It warned us to resist the undue optimism that can result form pressure, or face
the consequences of working on an impossible product.

I enjoyed Suzanne and Wouter Lagerweijs' session on eXtreme parenting. It was very much about
responding to change and the breakout sessions in small groups were a good
chance to meet other participants, and talk about parenting challenges. This showed once
again that workshops over Zoom can work, and even can have an intimate feel to them.

Nat and ?Julie?'s talk about Tiger Teams show what to do when your bluff gets
called, and you get all the things you asked for to solve the biggest problem in
a company.

I'm glad we sponsored this conference. I still need to watch the Alpaca's from
the break. If you feel you missed out, you can still get a ticket @@link, watch the
recordings and discuss on slack.
