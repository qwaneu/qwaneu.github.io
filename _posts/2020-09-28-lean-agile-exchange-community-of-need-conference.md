I was wondering if [Lean Agile Exchange](https://www.leanagileexchange.net/) on 10 and 11 September would be as much a Community of Need
conference as e.g. Lean Agile Scotland or Agile Cambridge were. I was not disappointed.

## What defines a Community of Need conference?

Steve Freeman recently recommended Chris Matts's presentation at and on Lean
Agile Scotland from four years ago about community of need versus community of
solutions conferences - 
[Communities of Need versus Communities of Practice](https://theitriskmanager.com/2015/04/19/communities-of-need-community-of-solutions/):

> The “Communities of Need” are centred on the creation of memes. Members of this community operate in the area of “Need” to create a meme and then work with the meme to identify fitness landscapes where it fails, and evolve them accordingly. These communities have problems that need to be solved. They take solutions developed for one context and attempt to implement them in their own context (exaptation), and modify (evolve) them as appropriate.

As Chris says:
> Community of solutions conferences often don't address the needs at all. Community of
solutions keynotes are highly polished, delivered by someone who has delivered
the same presentation ten times a year for twenty years.

The former describes Lean Agile Exchange to a large extent.

My quick summary animation looks like this:

_Dominant memes: principles dominate before the chasm, practices after. Read [Chris' post for the details](https://theitriskmanager.com/2015/04/19/communities-of-need-community-of-solutions/.)_

Community of Need sessions can be recognized by questions or uncomfortable
truths that don't necessarily sell anything. The keynotes at Lean Agile Exchange
were a good example of that. And hand-drawn slides, made in the spur of the moment.

The conference Slack channel was lively, with people asking questions like
*why do the programmers in my workplace believe functional programs don't need
tests*, and *Has anyone tried to authoritatively write down the names for things
used in the organisation?*

## Some sessions I enjoyed

### Cynicism Doesn't build products

From the regular sessions, the one by Gwen Diagram on Cynicism stood out. Gwen's
talk [Cynicism Doesn't Build Products](https://www.leanagileexchange.net/programme/cynicism-doesnt-build-products) was so full of energy, that I managed to stay awake for it after a long day
of on-line conference. An enormous amount of slides with photos and lively story
telling. It warned us to resist the undue optimism that can result form pressure, or face
the consequences of working on an impossible product.

### eXtreme Parenting

I enjoyed Suzanne and Wouter Lagerweij's session on [eXtreme p..arenting?](https://www.leanagileexchange.net/programme/extreme-parenting). It was very much about
responding to change. The breakout sessions in small groups were a good
chance to meet other participants, and talk about parenting challenges. This showed once
again that workshops over Zoom can work, and even can have an intimate feel to them. This is an example of _exaptation_.

### Tiger Team

[Taking the Tiger by the
tail](https://www.leanagileexchange.net/programme/taking-tiger-tail) by Nat
Price and Julie Camosseto was about what to do when your bluff gets
called, and you get all the things you asked for to solve the biggest problem in
a company. As that problem actually does turn out to be the biggest problem, and
not just hyperbole. Nat and Julie got to form a Tiger Team, and assemble all the
people they needed from around the world. This is an example of _evolving_
practice.

## I'm glad we sponsored

I'm glad we sponsored this conference. I still need to watch the Alpaca's from
the break. I did pace myself, skipping the occasional session like I would if it was an IRL conference made a difference.
