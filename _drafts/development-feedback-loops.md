# Three feedback loops in software product development

Inner loop - most leverage
- "Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."

"Good morning! One thing I'd like to add one thing to the 3 loops view on product development we used in the retro: even though you need to work on all 3 loops for being effective, (small) improvements in the inner development loop have the biggest effect because of multiplication effects. So it pays to invest time in improving build times, fixing flaky tests, getting quicker PR feedback, etc." @ZD


Middle loop:
- "Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential."

- Most Agile transformations tend to focus mostly on optimising the outer feedback loops of the development process, which produces disappointing results. To speed up delivery cycle times, focus on the innermost loop - build & test 
- The kernel of agility in software development - and the business models that rely on that software - is how long it takes to build and test your software. I can pretty accurately predict the future of a software-dependent business with that one metric.
- If your build + test times are slow, the cost of changing your systems will be high, and - no matter how successful you are now - you're just doing market research for a more agile competitor.
- The key point in my video on why Agile transformations tend to fail is they try to speed up nested feedback loops by focusing on the outer loops. As any programmer of performance-critical code will tell you, optimising the innermost loop usually produces much faster cycle times
