In any complex systems, there is no neutral position. One cannot take a neutral stance in a group, team, with a partner, ... When I am
part of a system, I will have influence on this system, whether I intend it or
not. Moving myself 'outside' the system, standing on the sidelines, "just
watching", not wanting to be part of it, does not remove me from the system.
Instead taking this stance will often have unintended consequences.

This also means that as a consultant, I might think I'm standing on the sidelines, observing the team, now and then prodding them to bring about change. In practice I am part of this, I need to be part of this to have influence. I'm in the system, even if I'm pretending to be standing outside. So when taking the 'outside' stance, I will influence the team even when I'm not prodding.

The system will also influence me! I'm part of the system, influencing is mutual. Again, Weinberg wrote about this in Secrets of Consulting, as *"Prescott's Pickle Principle"* - seeing consultants as cucumbers in an organization jar of brine ;) 

> "Cucumbers get more pickled than brine gets cucumbered. A small system that tries to change a big system through long and continued contact is more likely to be changed itself."

"Change is for other people" we sometimes joke as consultants, sometimes we think we're independent and it's just the organization needing to change. But we know that change is as much for us consultants as well.

The system touches us; whatever is happening, it will affect us; we will feel this. This can be exhausting (drowning in other people's problems) but if you learn to regulate this, it can provide a lot of information.

We have impact on a (complex) system by engaging with it, and only by engaging. We will become a part of that whole, for some time. Too much on the sideline means we will not have lasting impact.

Some more quotes (as cited by Abeba Birhane in her ["In defence of uncertainty" presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAkPbjx-gNc)):

> Objectivity is a subject's delusion that observing can be done without him. Invoking objectivity is abrogating responsibility &mdash; hence its popularity.

> Without the observer, there is nothing.
