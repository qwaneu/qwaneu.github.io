I made a last minute-ish decision to attend CITCON friday night and saturday. I don't normally attend conferences on the weekend, as I prefer to spend time with family. But this was in my neck of the woods - it was in Woking, my side of London - only about 2 hr drive from Bath. And I thought it would be fun to see some people in real life, and possibly learn something. Since it is an open space conference, their is a fair chance that interesting topics turn up, in sessions and outside. I was not disappointed, to say the least. I also got a chance to run a zeroth session on moldable development and my and Stephan Eggermonts' adventures with making sense of generated typescript.

Not only was it great to see new people and a bunch I hadn't seen for years, I also came away with a bunch of learning. Not everything conscious, it is slowly filtering out. I had a headache at the end of the day, and was not the only one. Each slot had at least one session I wanted to go to, and the hallway conversations were also great. Apologies for the somewhat bland writing, a lot of the discussions were confidential in nature. 

Spending some of CITCONs zero dollar marketing budget: if you want to be in on the conversations, attend the next one ;-). I didn't think I would consider travelling for a one and a half day conference, but now I am for next year.

# Continuous Improvement in Technology

One of the things I learnt is that CITCON now stands for Continuous Improvement in Technology Conference.

Paul Julius, one of the organisers, just wrote about [20 years of citcon](https://pauljulius.com/blog/citcon-conference-history.html). A good brief summary. It took people a long time to get into socio-technical topics from the looks of it. It is great that the conference still has a great blend of topics - dynamics often seem to be that more people feel they can go to 'socio' sessions than 'technical' sessions, that the latter gets drowned out, and the balance disappears, risking conferences that get detached from lived experience over time.



# Sessions

The [CITCON wiki](https://citconf.com/wiki/index.php) has an [overview of the sessions with notes](https://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=CITCONEurope2025Sessions). This saves me from writing some of my own.

## Teaching the next generation of software engineers - Robert Chatley

[session notes](https://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Teaching_Next_Gen_of_SW_Eng.) including a photo of the board. I particularly liked "Explore Simplicity" (neither easy to teach nor assess) and "Intelligent Disobedience". I had a note in a similar vein in my hand, but the Intelligent Disobedience added an ethics angle to it that I did not have. 

That left me free to explain why I feel Compilers should be in the curriculum (this warrants a separate rant post "why your software engineering program should have a compilers course", as some universities are dropping this). I just had so much fun doing the intro to compilers course at the University of Twente, and shortly after I started working, it turned out to be very practical. 

The course was quite challenging, and had additional levels that you could do for extra credit, which me and my pair did. In hindsight, this removed barriers to considering these things. I never made my own programming language or intricate domain specific languages, but it lowered the barrier to selecting, say, XML parsers, having a feeling for how to integrate these things in to web applications and when to swap one for another (or break it open and make modifications if needed). Having written some parsing code just days before, this seemed like a natural fit. Apparently my 'practical' take was unexpected. Which is good. I was glad to hear that Imperial College has compilers in the program still, and hope this inspires to keep it.
