When developing software, we sometimes tend to play down problems to create
simple solutions. In practice, things over time turn out not to be as simple as
assumed. The domain is usually way more complicated than anticipated. Security
constraints tend to impact on the design, etc.

Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for complex
needs by connecting the architecture and implementation to an evolving model of
the problem domain. It can be applied as an agile approach to software
development whilst recognising complexity.

Mastering DDD and working from your domain will help you develop higher quality
software products that will be better maintainable in the long run. It will
guide your architecture and component decisions.

## Goal

Get an overview of Domain Driven Design; learn the basic concepts and modelling
techniques like Domains, Bounded Contexts, Aggregates, Context Mapping, and
Event Storming.

## Means

We introduce Domain Driven Design as an approach to modelling and application
architecture. We will guide you through the different techniques and patterns
with lively hands-on modelling exercises. 

This workshop focuses on the domain modelling aspect of DDD. Implementation and
coding aspects are covered by the [Implementing Domain Driven Design workshop](/training/implementing-ddd).

## Audience & prerequisites

Software developers, testers, analysts, architects, product owners, agile
coaches; this workshop is suitable both for more junior participants who want to
grow and for more senior participants who'd like to sharpen their modelling
skills.

Having at least a year of experience in a software development environment is
recommended.

## Practical information

* Duration: 1 day
* No laptops required
