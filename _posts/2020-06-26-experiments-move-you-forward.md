Even when it doesn't feel like it.

In [the previous post](https://www.qwan.eu/2020/06/19/making-decisions-in-turbulent-times.html), I was wondering where **Bias to Action** was as a pattern.
While we were discussing experiments in that post, Ralph McArdell remarked:

"I would also argue that any decent experiment moves you forward as you gain
knowledge from the experiment."

Yes. Either it can be moved forward to a [Proof of Concept](https://www.cnpatterns.org/organization-culture/proof-of-concept-poc), or be discarded for
now. The idea is not viable now, or maybe never. And there, our first
action-biased pattern
[Proof of Concept](https://www.cnpatterns.org/organization-culture/proof-of-concept-poc) is staring us in the face. I even wrote it in yesterdays post.

The [Cloud Native pattern language](http://www.cnpatterns.org/) has some more action-biased patterns up its sleeve, e.g.
the [Research through Action](http://www.cnpatterns.org/strategy-risk-reduction/research-through-action) pattern:

> The challenges are new and complex, information is scarce, and the company is
> pushing to go fast.

Which can be combined with [Reduce Cost of Experimentation](http://www.cnpatterns.org/strategy-risk-reduction/reduce-cost-of-experimentation) :

> When someone has an idea that requires validation, the costs of doing
> experiments around it needs to be as low as possible.

If you do more experiments, you gain experience, while creating a system that
supports experiments, driving the cost down, which enables doing more
experiments and so a virtuous feedback loop can emerge.

More Knowledge results in more [Proofs of Concept](https://www.cnpatterns.org/organization-culture/proof-of-concept-poc) or more rejected hypotheses.

There are of course other ways of lowering the cost per experiment, and limiting
factors. For instance, success is its own worst enemy: do more Proof of
Concepts, have less capacity for experiments.
