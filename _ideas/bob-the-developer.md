Software developers are resourceful. Often they can make a solution work
technology challenges, resource constraints, unknowns

They/We tend to be like [Bob the Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_the_Builder); if someone asks if you can build it, you'll say yes, and you'll find a way to do so - for any project he takes on with his team, Bob's catchphrase is "can we fix it?". And the team always replies "Yes we can!"

This tends to make our stakeholders happy, at least initially. In our drive to build and fix stuff and make others happy, we skip over the questions if the thing needs fixing at all. Is the thing asked actually solving the problem? What is the problem behind the problem and should we be focusing on that?

We don't questions assumptions enough, instead we rush to the goal - let's fix it.

So instead of replying "yes we can!" (in words or deeds), it is often more useful to start asking questions:
- what value will it bring to you/our users/our customers/... if we build this?
- what happens if we don't build this? or if we don't build this first/now?
