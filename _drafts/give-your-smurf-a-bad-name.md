Choosing good names is one of the hard parts of our job as software developers. It's also a crucial part of our job, as names have a big impact on how well others (and our future selves) will be able to understand the code and be able to change it.

"Choose a bad name to trigger better naming" is a heuristic we often use when programming, but it also works for prose, the ordinary language people use in speaking or writing. 

In earlier times, Willem would choose swear words for names. It lightens the mood, when working alone, but is not conducive for group work. Calling it "smurf" is another option, making it obvious it needs a better name.
