When developing software, we sometimes tend to play down problems to create simple solutions. In practice, things over time turn out not to be as simple as assumed. The domain is usually way more complicated than anticipated. Security constraints tend to impact on the design, etc.

Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the architecture and implementation to an evolving model of the problem domain. It can be applied as an agile approach to software development whilst recognising complexity. Mastering DDD and working from your domain will help you develop higher quality software products that will be better maintainable in the long run.

While the [Introduction to Domain Driven Design course](https://www.qwan.eu/training/ddd-introduction) focuses on the modelling concepts of DDD, this workshop focuses on how DDD guides architectural decisions and how to refine a domain model to working code.

## Goal

Experience a number of implementation patterns of Domain Driven Design; practice how to derive an implementation from a domain model.


## Means

After a quick recap of the main Domain Driven Design concepts, we introduce the running case for the workshop. We start from an event storm and through a number of refinements and hands-on programming exercises will implement a part of the domain model.

$fter a quick recap of the main Domain Driven Design concepts, we introduce the running case for the workshop. we start from an existing domain model (an event storming result from [Introduction to Domain Driven Design](https://www.qwan.eu/training/ddd-introduction)) and through a number of hands-on programming exercises  we will implement a part of the domain model. 

We will cover the following DDD tactical patterns:

\- Aggregates and Aggregate Roots

\- Commands and Command Handlers

\- Read Models and Queries

\- Policies and Event Handling


## Audience & prerequisites

Software developer and hands-on architects; this workshop is suitable both for more junior developers who want to grow and for more senior developers whoâ€™d like to sharpen their skills. Programming experience is required for this workshop.

The [Introduction to Domain Driven Design course](https://www.qwan.eu/training/ddd-introduction) or equivalent knowledge is required.


## Practical information

* Duration: 1 day
* This training is available as in-house training only.
