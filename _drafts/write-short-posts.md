Sometimes I think: "this is not enough for a blogpost"; I&rsquo;ll make a LinkedIn post out of it. As a reader, my feed is like a firehose. For instance, I see a nice write-up from Rob Bowley or Simon Wardley. Then after reading some of teh references, coming back to the timeline, the post has moved away ðŸ˜º.

In case you wonder, the same holds for non-algorithmic timelines - e.g. Mastodon. I can&rsquo;t even find my own messages back!

I would like to see some of your shorter writings as blog posts. So I can read and bookmark them in peace.

This is of course also about giving myself license to post shorter posts. I&rsquo;m editing some of my explorations in large language models into posts, and they are either long and meandering, or short. I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy a couple of short ones. And of course I also enjoy long posts, for instance this one [on how Jurgen Appelo use the theory of constraints to decide where to use LLMs for writing novels.](https://substack.jurgenappelo.com/p/humans-are-the-bottleneck)
