Here are seven things we found interesting reading for this week.

## 6 Thinking modes for helping you get un-stuck

[6-thinking-modes-for-helping-you-get-un-stuck/](https://salfreudenberg.wordpress.com/2016/06/05/6-thinking-modes-for-helping-you-get-un-stuck/) by Sal Freudenberg. Somewhat mischievously labeled 0 to 5, where 0 is 'Tacit' - things you do you just "know how" to do. The others are Hierarchical, Multi-faceted, Opportunistic and Creative.

## Unlearning Ineffective or Obsolete Technologies

[Unlearning Ineffective or Obsolete Technologies](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/wstarbuc/unlearn.html/](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/wstarbuc/unlearn.html) by William H. Starbuck, New York University,
Published in the International Journal of Technology Management, 1996, 11: 725-737.

Often before learning something new, we have to unlearn something we know. We sometimes introduce people to practices they don't know, or think they know, but we approach them very differently (e.g. Test Driven Devleopment). I particularly like this one: "All causal arrows have two heads."

I found this through [a summary by John Clapham](https://johnclapham.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/before-we-learn-must-we-first-unlearn/). if you have a little time, read Johns' summary, if you have more time, read Williams'.


## Why seven reads?

Don't know ;-). Seven plus or minus two seems to be a good number, and (rationalizing after the fact), there are seven days in the week, so we can collect one thing a day, and you can read one thing a day.

This is a little experiment we'll be running for a few weeks. We enjoy reading - not all of us at the same time, and not necessarily the same things, and we hope you'll find these enjoyable. The hypothesis for this experiment is that it helps us better preserve the reading we love, and summarizing them helps at least one of us read them a bit more in depth and keeping track of reads that might be useful to share later.
