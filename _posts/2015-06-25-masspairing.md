title:  An experience in Mass Pairing
author: Willem

A Mass Pairing is a coding dojo that takes over all sessions for a slot
during a conference. We've found it a great way to introduce
participants to each other, and explore an aspect of programming at a
conference. We had some pleasant suprrises, and still have some questions.

I'm facilitating a Mass Pairing exercise for the third time at [/dev/summer in Cambridge this saturday](http://www.devcycles.net/2015/summer),
and also facilitating one at the [SPA
Conference](http://spaconference.org/spa2015/social.html) where the
programme rightfully labels it as a [Coding
Dojo](http://www.codingdojo.org), since it does not take over the entire
conference for a slot.  

At /dev/summer the [Mass
Pairing](http://devcycles.net/2015/summer/programme/) hijacks (in the
most friendly way) the conference for an
entire slot after lunch. the after lunch slot is bad for talks anyway,
pair programming gives people some energy to start the afternoon with. 

The Mass Pairing is polyglot by design. The previous two times we
achieved that by starting with an open ended exercise (Game of life and
eight queens) that participants
could do in whatever language they want, as long as one can write tests
with it. [This time we're doing a legacy
code exercise](https://github.com/mostalive/masspairing), so the choice is a bit more limited although still
fairly large. I've done the Gilded Rose kata in Haskell a couple of
times, and it was more interesting than I expected.

### Maximum Participation

One of the reasons to do a Mass Pairing in a plenary session, is to make
it very hard for participants to leave without having done a hands-on
exercise. Talks are great to get some broader insights, but for deeper
learning writing code while having a discussion with someone else is
essential. 

### Minimal Facilitation

For a succesful session we need three ingredients:

- Every participant needs to find a partner (or two). This is the
  scariest bit for me.
- Participants need a starting point for the exercise - we need enough
  participants with laptops. It turns out that, on a saturday, it is
ever so attractive to leave the laptop at home.
- Said partner should program in a language of choice. We more or less
  solved this by pointing people to rooms for specific languages we
defined in advance. It feels a bit limited, because we might miss
opportunities for people to work in languages we haven't thought of. 

For /dev/summer last year, we arranged a facilitator in every room. For
/dev/winter this year, we chose not to, and see how it would work
without. 

I was just browsing through photos I took at /dev/winter and found this:

![Some rooms facilitated themselves by drawing an example game board](/attachments/blogposts/2015/masspairing-self-facilitation.jpg)

In at least one room participants drew a sample gameboard together. That
was a pleasant surprise. I encouraged some rooms to do wrap-ups, but if
you've been at a coding exercise before, you know how hard it is to get
people to step away from the keyboard. Suggestions for a friendly  way
to get participants to stop and wrap-up at the end would be most
welcome.

In general the Mass Pairings seem to be well-received, but since we
don't facilitate in the rooms, we don't really get accurate feedback
other than what we hear at the bar afterwards. 

I'm thinking of doing a round of the rooms, handing out index cards near the end of the session, and asking each participant to
write one thing they learnt on it, and then collecting the most
interesting ones in a blog post or a series of tweets. I welcome your suggestions for
collecting better feedback (or if you've participated, your opinion in
the comments). 

If you want to experience Mass Pairing for yourself, I believe there are
still a few tickets for
[/dev/summer](http://www.devcycles.net/2015/summer), one of the best
value for money conferences you'll find. I'm not always that confident,
but of this I'm pretty sure :-). See you then?
