- event driven architecture: often applied to "decouple"
- (de)coupling is a multifaceted thing
- EDA: you decouple in time (sync -> async), not meaning
  - so if you cut at the wrong places, you will make the coupling worse
  - "schijnontkoppeling"
- trade-offs: time decoupling introduces eventual consistency - not bad or good per se, but you need to think about it (consistency is also a business decision!)
