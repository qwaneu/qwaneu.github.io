---

<p>Our refactoring cue cards let you visualize refactorings easily.
We designed them to teach code smells and refactoring. The cards are
also handy to break down refactorings in work situations, for instance
when doing a code review or while carrying out a set of refactorings.
</p>
<p align="center"><img title="A few sample
cards from the deck"

alt="Front side of the cardbox, depicting two smell cards and a
refactoring card stacked on each other." width="307" height="236" /></p>

<p>Half of the deck consists of code smell cards, the other half explains
refactorings. A smell card explains how to detect the smell and refers
to possible refactorings that could help make it go away. Refactoring
cards have a small diagram (a 'refactoring thumbnail) showing the before
and after situation on one side, and an explanation of the
refactoring mechanics on the other side.
</p>

<p>An explanation on how to use them is on the back of the pack. The
pack also contains a list of references and a few blank cards to add
your own smells and refactorings.
