Happy new year! We are restarting open enrollment courses this year. The first one up is our test driven Java course. This will take place in Utrecht, Netherlands in March 19 and 20 in 2020.

You can [contact us directly for discounted group bookings](https://www.qwan.eu/#contact), or [book through springest](https://www.springest.nl/qwan/hands-on-test-driven-development-in-java) for individual bookings.

We've been iterating on this training for several years, always making sure it stays fun, you get something out of it for your next working day, as well as making participants think hard about their practice.

Still reading? go on then, read the [Detailed course description](https://www.qwan.eu/training/test-driven-development). We hope to see you there.

Have you been before? [We'd love to hear](https://www.qwan.eu/#contact) what impact the course has had on your work.
