We use test names or test descriptions to tell what the test is about: what is
the action or event, what is the expected result?

If we name our tests like this, a test case will read like a specification of
the object under test (in particular in a test report or when you look at your
tests collapsed in your IDE). A good test name will also make the test more
readable.

```java
// A nondescriptive name: 
public void testDeliver() { ...

// We prefer: 
public void deliversCanWhenPaidEnough() { ...
```

## Effects 

Trying to catch the test's intention in the name also helps to think of what
exactly we're trying to do in the test. If it is hard to find a good name, we
probably don't understand what we are trying to capture in the test.

We are not afraid of long names, but we want to prevent long, vague sentences.
Names containing 'and' are a hint that there might be two (or more!) tests 
in there.

This heuristic helps thinking Given-When-Then: the test name gives a summary 
of the When and the Then.

##Â notes

show some spec based tests.
Side note: when the set up is extracted out (in purescript or haskell often injected in) it might not be that useful. In some languages we can move the order of our expectation/assert function, so that it can go in the middle of a sentence. If the test is glanceable, the string above it may be reduntant.

@@example from WeReview

actual `shouldEqual` expected

(side note, might be separate post This struck me first in some property based tests, where it was really hard to give the test a name, but after extractions, the test itself was quite simple).

Post needed: glanceable tests.
