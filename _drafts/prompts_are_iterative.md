I find that wishful thinking is great. And the barrier to ask your computer a question is low. So make a habit of asking your computer questions. It can work wonders, and if not, it might get you rolling on the floor laughing. 

*Just install the cloud app already* I tend to overcomplicate things. So I've made it easy to just use llms. I still have a ChatGPT subscription, and installed the app on my phone and tablet, so if I have some time to kill, I can mess around with it. There is also gemini inside google docs (I did not manage to switch this off), with a workspace subscription, and google workspace.

I also like my privacy, I am still looking for good IOS apps for phone and tablet. I am trying `mollama` it seems allright, but is quite technical in it's look and feel and had trouble loading a message - suggestiosn welcome!

Run *local models on your computer**

I'll write about installing local models on your laptop separately, if anyone is interested. This field moves fast, and some tools will get you started, but also might leave you scratching your head.
I have collected a few tips that work well for me, and might work well for you.

Who is this post for?

- you want to do more with large language models (e.g ChatGPT), but don't feel confident

- you feel somewhat confident, but can use more practice.

I heard someone in the first categoy saying that they are not confident in writing prompts, and should go on a course to learn how to prompt. That is an option, of course. I also think that if you can ask questions, you can create a feedback loop in which you ask questions, look at the answer, and reflect on the process. You probably will reflect, consciously or not. Deliberate practice works.

Wouter Lagerweij is in the first category - he remarked that he should practice writing prompts more. I believe this is the right thing to do - deliberate practice works well here. And I've found it a lot of fun.



(we have a double introduction here, maybe rewrite the second one). Possibly the term 'Prompt engineering' doesn't help in the context of a casual user who is figuring out how to get more out of LLMs for their daily work.

(this might go in the conclusion)
There is a time and place for precise terminology, but casual use is probably not that place. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride!

Everything you always wanted to know about *subject* but didn't dare to ask.

So how do we practice?
====

- Ask the LLM how to ask it questions and give it instructions (reflective prompting)
- Just do it
- Keep a <strikethrough>notebook</strikethrough> PEN pal
- Let the computer make the notebook
- Invite the computer into your notebook
- Pitfall: Disable auto-complete when writing prompts


Just do it!
