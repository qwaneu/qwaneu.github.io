> **Being alive**  
> The search which we make for this quality, in our own lives, is the central search of any person, and the crux of any individual person's story. It is the search for those moments and situations when we are most alive.  
>-- The Timeless Way of Building, p. 41

Last week, [Christopher
Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) passed away at
the age of 85. Alexander was an architect with profound new ideas on habitable
architecture. What's probably not widely known within IT is that his ideas have
had a profound influence on software development as well: he inspired the
patterns movement in software in the 90s, and indirectly influenced the rise of
agile software development, which grew out of the patterns movement.

For me personally, Alexander's ideas and work have been a great source of
inspiration and influence as well for the last 25 years, ever since I discovered
his work.

In the mid 90s, Willem and I were studying Computer Science at the University of
Twente. We learned about design patterns in our 4th year I think, while working
as a student assistant. We were fascinated by this new concept and started
digging into where the the design pattern concept came from, leading us to
Christopher Alexander's work. I wanted to learn more! In the university library
I found copies of [The Timeless Way of
Building](https://www.patternlanguage.com/bookstore/timeless-way-of-building.html)
and [Notes on the Synthesis of
Form](https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Synthesis-Form-Harvard-Paperbacks/dp/0674627512). 

Reading the *Timeless Way* was a life-changing experience. It is a
wonderful book to read, well written, with wonderful, timeless black-and-white
photos. The philosophy Alexander wrote about touched me, although at that time I
could not yet fully grasp it. But I was hooked! The book introduced the idea of
"quality without a name" - the quality that we feel, that we know that is there
in a place, but we cannot put this quality in words. Words like
'whole' or 'comfortable' do not fully capture it.

In the years that followed, I got my own copies of The Timeless Way, A Pattern
Language and Notes on the Synthesis of Form. I devoured Richard P. Gabriel's
[Patterns of Software - Tales from the Software
Community](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Software-Tales-Community/dp/0195121236)
book. I also got my hands on the beautiful [A Foreshadowing of 21st Century
Art](http://www.patternlanguage.com/bookstore/foreshadowing-of-21st-century-art.html)
book (the Turkish carpets book) which unfortunately is hard to get hold of
nowadays.

Another seminal book that builds on Alexander's work is [Stewart
Brand](https://twitter.com/stewartbrand)'s [How Buildings
Learn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn), a beautiful book about how buildings evolve over time. Most change takes
place _after_ a building is initially built, and there are several shearing
layers of change within a building, each moving at its own pace.

These books have had a significant influence on me and on my perspective on
software development and how to grow development organizations. When I started
my own company in the mid-2000s, I was looking for a name that reflected my
perspective. I turned to the Timeless Way for inspiration - re-reading it brings
joy every time. I chose 'Piecemeal Growth' as the name for my company. 

The concept of *piecemeal growth* refers to the continuous process by which
buildings, neighborhoods, cities develop. Habitable places don't come from some
grand design, but from a continuous process of building and repairing any
misfits. Complex systems are not designed, but grow iteratively and
incrementally, continuously. This also holds for software development and the
way teams and organizations develop. They all grow piecemeal.

In 2008, [Willem, Rob and I](/#team) decided to join forces and start
working together under a shared name. After several whiteboard discussions, we
turned to our shared source of inspiration - Christopher Alexander. We took up
the name 'QWAN - Quality Without a Name', an aspirational goal for us, a thing
we are looking for within software development, together with our clients. 

Last week, I finally got round to start reading Alexander's [The Nature of
Order](https://www.patternlanguage.com/bookstore/nature-of-order.html), which
lays down a novel view on order and life. The four volumes had been on my
bookshelf for a long time, but I hadn't yet found the time to read it. Last
week, I finally started in the first volume.

Sadly, Alexander passed away last week. I appreciate him for his contributions
to our field and for the influence he has had on me.
