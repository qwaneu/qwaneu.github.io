Here are seven things we found interesting reading for this week.

## 6 Thinking modes for helping you get un-stuck

[6-thinking-modes-for-helping-you-get-un-stuck/](https://salfreudenberg.wordpress.com/2016/06/05/6-thinking-modes-for-helping-you-get-un-stuck/) by Sal Freudenberg. Somewhat mischievously labeled 0 to 5, where 0 is 'Tacit' - things you do you just "know how" to do. The others are Hierarchical, Multi-faceted, Opportunistic and Creative.



## Why seven reads?

Don't know ;-). Seven plus or minus two seems to be a good number, and (rationalizing after the fact), there are seven days in the week, so we can collect one thing a day, and you can read one thing a day.

This is a little experiment we'll be running for a few weeks. We enjoy reading - not all of us at the same time, and not necessarily the same things, and we hope you'll find these enjoyable. The hypothesis for this experiment is that it helps us better preserve the reading we love, and summarizing them helps at least one of us read them a bit more in depth and keeping track of reads that might be useful to share later.
