# introduction

We are seeing 'agile transformations' and other improvement initiatives that deliver some improvement, but not as much as initially hoped for.
Groups work somewhat iteratively, but delivering valuable product with software inside still takes too long and costs too much. All the while, technical debt continues to mount.

# So now what? Should we bet the house on technical excellence?

(ref to Jason). No, in this post we introduce a part of our perspective on software development. Software development is an interplay between three feedback loops. All three need love and care. 


# A systemic perspective: three interdependent feedback loops

This is a work in progress, informed by a Jason gorman demonstrating the influence of technical excellence on speed, as well as the agile fluency model (R TM C) that we have used to generate conversations with clients. We are using a slightly different terminology here, as we are exploring the space, we focus more on how the feedback loops function and interact with each other, less on specific capabilities.

So the three loops we consider here are, from inside to outside:

- Technical Excellence loop
- Working together + getting things done loop
- Product loop

# Leverage effects

At our clients the technical excellence loop goes through more, and quicker cycles than the other loops. This means that improvements made here have a faster pay off, as well as a higher return on investment.

(thinking of a fake chart where the area below the tech excellence improvement grows faster, sort of like a CFD for the three loops)


# We need a whole systems approach (holistic approach?)

Doest hat mean we should focus exclusively on the technical excellence loop? No, Velocity is a vector, it has a quantity and a direction (ref @jessitron on velocity / accelleration). We can improve the quantity in the technical excellence loop, but direction has to come from the interplay with the other loops. 

Lets' have a look at some counter examples:

- Developers invest in technical solutions while ignoring the voice of the stakeholders. This makes us go faster on a road to nowhere.
- Sales sell too many things that don't exist yet, or aren't feasible yet. There is always a tension, but improving in the sales capacity with a lack of capability to deliver is likely to lead to disappointed stakehoders and developers. 
- Only improve the getting things done loop: We find better ways of moving post-its, and reflecting on them (or JIRA tickets), but when development can't actually move the tickets, we might be going somewhere, but very slowly with lots of 'clever' fixing to make our solution work for customers.
- Product: better vision (e.g. good strategy, great event storms, UX studies) without a solid organisation of teams and communication with developers will once again lead to disappointment.

# how is this perspective helpful?

Clients often find it difficult to justify e.g. developer training. We find that just the act of stepping away from the keyboard and reflecting with a group of developers (almost regardless of content) leads to improved productivity. Some of the effects of stepping away are permanent (e.g. better builds), but others are temporary (practicing working in small steps, refactoring are general skills, but they tend to atrophy under pressure).

# closing notes

3 loops perspectief is niet allesomvattend maar biedt een nuttig perspectief (er zijn meer nuttige perspectieven)
