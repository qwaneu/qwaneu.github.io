Working fully from is quite a challenge in some ways. Invididual teams have there way of working and can usually adapt.
The move to remote is a big organizational change however. It is not the same organization but with everyone just situated at home! 

An organization is a (complex) system, that not only consists of the employees, teams and the hierarchy. The system also includes the informal structures, value creation structures, the physical environment, all influencing each other. And some of these structures have been changed overnight, not without impact. In this post, we will focus on how the informal structures are impacted. @@+bron van 'value creation structure': Team Topologies

For managers for instance it has become very difficult to sense what is going on, which the teams, which the people. There is a lot of value in walking around, running into people, having a short chat (listing, observing), and in this way observing early the many weak signals in an organization. Managers use these early, weak signals to do small and timely interventions. Example: a new hire sends out some unhappy signals during a chat at the coffee machine, manager can dive deeper, find out the person has some trouble finding their place, and help them out a bit. When you don't have access to those signals, the manager might find out about it when the new hire turns in their resignation letter, and then all damage has been done & it is too late.

## Formal vs informal organization strcutures

Formal organization: team structure & membership & roles; management hierarchy / reporting lines; the "scrum structure", regular demos, planning sessions, etc. Note: working with teams applies more structure to an organization and in this way emphasises/reinforces the formal structure. Also: having to account for every hour on the right project is also formal structure.

Informal organization: varies from the semi-coincidental meetings at coffee machines or hallways, to internal meetups, lunch & learns, gatherings, communities of practice 


The informal structure often gets lower priority; especially when working agile or scrum, emphasis is mostly on the formal structure and creating a formal stucture for teams to deliver value. Scrum facilitates overly structured organizations.

The informal structure is however crucial for an organization: 50-70% of learning inside an organization comes from informal networks (source: Dave Snowden)Without informal networks, org does not have ability to connect in novel/unexpected ways. So low informal structure means less/no innovation/innovation capability. This is what you see happening in bureaucracies (optimizing the formal structure, but becoming more rigid and less able to adapt/innovate).

In informal network, trust is automatic, in formal networks not; in formal networks, it takes lot of time to build trust. Informal network tend not to be transparent, "transparency is enemy of innovation and trust" (Dave Snowden) "Trust has low energy cost in informal network, high energy cost in formal setting" (Snowden)

You organize (and reorganize) the formal structure of an organization. You facilitate the informal structure to happen. You cannot organize the informal structure, by definition. Installing committees or working groups is a form of formal structure; it is a way to impose order (managers sometimes do this if there is a problem or something is not working out @@+voorbeeld?), it is not informal structure, even if it would bring together people across the organization.

Organizations tend to 'reorganize', i.e. change the formal structure, e.g. if it is currently not working out. This is a change that has very high energy cost, because it breaks any carefully built up trust in formal structures so that you have to start all over again, trust-wise.

## Impact of sudden remoteness

Now that everyone suddenly needs to work remotely, most what remains is the formal structure, with some adaptation to make it work remotely. 
Informal structure happens because organizations create space for it to happen (both physical space, but also in terms of time/budget available). This is not always explicit or conscious: remember the coffee machine story from Weinberg's Psychology of Computer Programming.

Working remote does not necessarily mean no informal structure. There are a number of remote-by-design companies that (seem to) manage this well. Examples: [[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about) (57 employees, since ~2004), [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) (the company behind Wordpress, >1100 employees, since 2005). They have written books about how they work. 

## What _can_ you do?

Offices tend to play a role in creating space for informal structure to happen (or not happen). It allows people to meet and have conversations. @@link patterns
We need different ways of creating that space.

Other dynamic: working from home means reduced facilitation of informal structures, so the formal structures automatically fill in.

Some options:
- online company open space meetings, allocate time and create opportunity for people to meet and bond
- lunch and learns, hang around afterwards (stimulate this / facilitate this!)
- teams have an open meeting room, where others can also drop by
- explicitly "give permission" to people to spend time on these meetings
- have occasional face-to-face meetings (in a safe way); although this is easier to organize for individual teams than for semi-coincidentally formed groups of people or for people linked by interest

And: reduce the amount of formal structure, and reduce transparency (a bit): scrum is overly structured, this is its advantage (ensures team focuses on a goal and organizes everything around that), but it pushes out room for informal stuff; while in the office, you would walk to the coffee machine frequently, have a smoke outside, or have a long lunch walk that provided space in between the formal structure; things you can still do while working remotely, but it does not create space for the informal structure to thrive.

Your work day becomes 8 hour focused work, or 4 + 4 hours focused work with a few cups of coffee and a lunch break; you feel the pressure, you feel you're supposed to spend the 4+4 hours on backlog work, on the team's goal, and you have to account for that in the next standup meeting.

Focused work/focused is a good thing, but not all there is. You need the unfocused time as well.
