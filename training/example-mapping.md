Do you have long, boring refinement sessions? Do you still run into big surprises and lack of shared understanding when building the software?

In this hands on workshop, we introduce you to Example Mapping, a simple
workshop format that brings focus to your refinements. It will get you faster to
a shared understanding, surface big unknowns earlier, and make the process much
more enjoyable. 

Example Mapping is a simple, pen-and-paper technique invented by Matt Wynne (of
Cucumber fame), which helps to have a more focused, structured conversation
about your user stories.

## Goal

Learn Example Mapping as a whole-team refinement technique

## Means

We start out with a little bit of theory and then quickly get to a hands-on
group exercise, applying Example Mapping to a case we bring in. There is
sufficient room for reflection, discussion and questions.

We will also show how the examples that come out of the workshop can be
transformed into automated tests.

## Audience & Prerequisites

testers

Some experience working in an agile team is required.
