    <p>The buffadoo (also spelled as bouffadou, boufadoo), also known in France as "the tool for lighting the fire without burning your mustache," was created long ago, in the far reaches of the Aubrac and GÃ©vaudan plateaus. It is a long, hollow, wooden tube to deliver air directly to a specific location in a fire. A buffadoo brings fresh air and energy to an existing fire. It's a simple, precise and effective device. And a warm fire never fails to connect people.</p>
